Faith March, 18 from Maldon, Essex, was surviving on nothing other than coffee when she dropped to her lowest weight in March of last year. After several ill-fated attempts to fight the illness, Faith collapsed in her bathroom where she was found by her boyfriend - and her family told her they feared for her life if she didn't get help.

Faith March's weight dropped to just five stone when she was suffering from anorexia (left) but she is now in recovery and has set up her own patisserie business (right) After treatment at the Priory Hospital in Chelmsford, Faith is now at a healthier weight and credits the starting of her patisserie business, Whisk of Faith, as kick-starting her recovery. Faith said: 'This business has helped me get out of a massive hole. If I'm honest, it was a hole I never thought I would get out of. It just seemed like a never-ending cycle of problems.' Faith says she has had problems with her stomach which have baffled doctors for most of her life, but at 14 she was finally told her colon had collapsed and had surgery to insert a stent into her stomach. That returned her to some sort of normality, but in March last year her eating problems began to worsen and those around her began to notice. Faith said: 'My boyfriend, mum and dad noticed I had stopped eating again, I was just surviving on coffee,' she said. 'I was doing a cookery course at the time as well as working part time at a pub so I was surrounded by food but I just couldn't bring myself to eat anything.

Faith looks happy as she poses in her chefs outfit complete with an apron with the name of her company on the front . 'My boss told me to take some time out because it was clear I wasn't 100 per cent so I went to the doctors and that is when I was told I had anorexia. 'I knew I always had problems with food but to actually be diagnosed as anorexic just played havoc with my mind. Faith continued: 'I tried to combat it in so many ways that I look back on now and think 'what was I doing?' such as just staying in bed, working out at the gym all the time and just generally not accepting help. Then, a terrifying episode later that year made it hit home just how bad her problem was. Faith said: 'After one long day working from 11am until 10pm at the pub in which I hadn't eaten, my boyfriend found me collapsed on the bathroom floor.

'We went on holiday and my family told me they thought I would die if I carried on working in that environment. 'It hit me then. I realised something needed to be done to save my life. Faith quit her job and spent time at home recuperating, which got her thinking about ways to get herself better. 'I always wanted my own business so Mum told me to maybe do some work for myself while I get better,' she said.

There's no movie yet, but \"Community's\" much-awaited sixth season made its debut. Not even cancellation by NBC could kill the fan favorite sitcom, as Yahoo streamed the first two episodes of the new season early Tuesday. The show appears to have suffered no decline in quality in the move to Yahoo, though cast member Yvette Nicole Brown (now on CBS' \"The Odd Couple\") had to leave the show for family reasons. The premiere briefly touches on this in its own way, with Shirley's absence sounding a lot like the setup for a spinoff (as the character Abed points out, along with several other inconsistencies throughout the episode). The \"new Shirley,\" as Dean joked, is Paget Brewster's Frankie, who exists to play the disapproving authority figure to antagonize the former study group. Soon, the group was running a Prohibition-esque bar before they could learn to live with Frankie. And how about the end of the first episode, which gave us a look at the spinoff, \"The Butcher and the Baker,\" with Shirley and Steven Weber as a Southern lawyer? Episode two got even more out there, with Dean Pelton's adventures in 1990s-style virtual reality and a less-successful plotline involving Britta's parents. Most interesting was the introduction of Keith David as '90s tech genius Elroy. Critics praised the show, with The Hollywood Reporter's Amy Amatangelo saying, \"Everything fans loved about Community remains -- the first two episodes are chock-full of increasingly bizarre pop-culture references (Portuguese Gremlins, anyone?) and meta commentary. The show has seamlessly transferred to an online venue.\" Time's James Poniewozik also liked it (despite some reservations about the plot), writing, \"The first thing that matters is if the latest reboot still has the comedy goods, and it does.\" Soon after the show went online, devoted fans on Twitter had their say.", "reference": "The fan favorite comedy \"Community\" returns for a sixth season on Yahoo .\nThe series is just as weirdly hilarious as ever, with surprises in store .\nCritics and fans loved the premiere .", "prediction": "\" community ' s \" sixth season made its debut tuesday. the show has suffered no decline in quality in the move to yahoo. fans on twitter had their say on the show."}

Sean was first pictured dancing enthusiastically at what appeared to be a concert last month. But after the bullying cameraman and his friend started laughing at him, he bowed his head in shame. The bullies later uploaded the two, contrasting photos of Sean to the anonymous message board, 4chan, alongside the nasty message labeling him a 'specimen' and criticizing his carefree dancing. The post was then screenshot and posted on Imgur, where it attracted the attention of thousands of social media users, including Ms Fairbanks, who said she was 'horrified' by its 'cruel' nature.

'Kind-hearted gesture': Although the group were concerned of embarrassing Sean by tweeting the photos, they decided that the benefits of successfully locating and standing up for the Dancing Man outweighed the risks . Supporting Sean: Emma Roid tweeted to Sean: 'If you see this, we want you to know that we've got your back' More support: Another user, with the handle @tinypants', said she hoped someone on Twitter could identify Sean - before his name was revealed. 'Half the Internet wants to give him a hug,' she wrote, using the hashtag . Fellow dancing enthusiast: Charlie Heapy added: 'We need to #FindDancingMan and have a big dancing party!'

The two University of Oklahoma students at the center of a racist fraternity video have more than sports in common. They're both under fire since the nine-second clip showed them making racial slurs against blacks. In it, students at the now-disbanded Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity clap, pump their fists and laugh as they hurl racial slurs and make a reference to lynching. School officials have expelled Parker Rice and Levi Pettit because of their alleged \"leadership role\" in the racist chant. Here's what we know about the two students: . Rice, 19,  was raised in Dallas, where he recently graduated  from Jesuit College Preparatory School. In high school, he was an avid sportsman, and he played cornerback on the football team, in addition to baseball, The Dallas Morning News reported. His father, Bob Rice, is a real estate agent in Dallas, where he volunteers for various organizations, including a baseball league and the local YMCA, according to the newspaper. Earlier this year, a sibling of the younger Rice described their close relationship in an interview with their high school newspaper. In the article, the brother says they enjoy playing video games and watching movies together. Rice has apologized for the video, calling his actions wrong and reckless. \"I made a horrible mistake by joining into the singing and encouraging others to do the same,\" he said in a statement Tuesday. His family has fled their home, where protesters gathered Wednesday. They've also wiped out their social media accounts. As the university tries to heal after days of controversy, some are rallying to Rice's defense. Matthew Lopez,  a friend and fellow student at the university, said the video is not a reflection of who he is. \"That video does not represent his core personality,\" Lopez said. \"Unfortunately though, as things are, that might define him for a while. But it does not define him personally, I feel.\" Lopez described him as a \"charismatic, good person, with a good soul and a good spirit\" who experienced a lapse in judgment. \"His behavior is a result of his influence of the fraternity system and the traditions that have been embedded since pre-civil war times, when the fraternity was made, which obviously weren't the most tolerant times,\" Lopez said. The second student expelled, Pettit does not have much of a digital footprint. What appears to be his now deleted Twitter page mainly focuses on his musings about college football. Pettit played golf at his alma mater, Highland Park High School, The Dallas Morning News reported. In a statement, his parents said their son made a horrible mistake and apologized to African-Americans, students and university faculty. \"He is a good boy, but what we saw in those videos is disgusting,\" Brody and Susan Pettit said. \"While it may be difficult for those who only know Levi from the video to understand, we know his heart, and he is not a racist.\" CNN has reached out to both students but has not heard back from Rice.

Plastic doll Lammily - who was created as an antidote to Barbie's super-slim frame - is being used to teach us about our bikini body obsession. The brown-haired figure confronts her fears on a trip to the beach and sees other women there with flaws and scars, making her realise that no one's perfect. Scroll down for video . In the new Lammily advert the 'average barbie' is shown with stretch marks, the ad is meant to highlight the pressures women are under to be bikini ready . Highlighting the pressures on women to look 'swimwear ready,' at all times the magazine reads, 'Are you bikini ready?' She then starts looking at her friend's Facebook page where they have posted a bikini picture with the mocking hashtags, #plasticperfection, #donthate, #thighgapclub, #bikinibody, #youknowit. In what seems to be a parody of the Victoria's Secret show - famous for its underwear clad models - two barbies then start twerking on a stage as average Barbie looks on. She is then confronted by adverts for a 'dolly tuck,' and one which says you can lose half an inch in two weeks - a reference to the dolls small waists. In the advert Lammily is constantly faced with adverts which tell her she can lose weight quickly - the same images women see in real life . The doll is initially seen with red cheeks when she gets to the beach because she is embarrassed by her bikini body . However when she finally heads to the beach average Lammily realises that everyone there has their own issues. Some have stretch marks, others have spots and one has a scar across her stomach. The dolls creator Nickolay Lamm, a digital artist who majored in marketing at the University of Pittsburgh, said of making the ad: 'I was thinking about how Lammily, in the fashion doll world, would feel very out of place. I think one of the hardest things to do in life is to be yourself.' Lammily also looks at magazines which ask her 'Are you beach ready?' When Lammily sees the other dolls on the beach she soon realises that they all have their issues with their bodies . Lammily was first created in 2014 as the result of a crowd-funding project. Nickolay felt that there was no doll on the market that represented real women. More than 13,000 people signed up to the project with 19,000 of the dolls being pre-ordered. You can buy clothes to fit on the doll as well as stickers which show scars, stretch marks and acne just like normal women have. Nickolay, speaking in the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, said: 'I’m an artist, plus event planner, email checker, data entry person, graphic designer and pizza delivery driver. My goal isn’t to make a ton of money. I just want to create the most awesome content on the Internet.' If you buy a Lammily doll then you can buy stickers to go on her - for example these stretch mark stickers which show the marks many women have on their bodies .

Mr Shapps, posing as his business guru alter-ego Michael Green, used online leaflets to boast of his wealth and status in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions. Using pictures of himself in his private plane and six-bedroom mansion, the future Tory minister offered his 'friends' the chance to learn how to make their fortune –as long as they handed him $197, worth £130. Scroll down for video . Mr Shapps used pictures of himself in his private plane with his son in a bid to prove that he knew how to make millions . Mr Shapps said his wealth was 'hard-core' evidence of that he could help people get rich. The revelations come just days after Mr Shapps, 46, faced calls to quit after being forced to admit he had continued to offer get-rich-quick advice after becoming a Conservative MP despite vehement denials to the contrary. The Tory minister had insisted he had not had a second job since being elected MP for Welwyn Hatfield in May 2005, but was later forced to admit he had 'screwed up' by denying the allegations 'over firmly'. It comes after a recording emerged from 2006, a year after he was elected to Parliament, capturing the MP selling self-help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a 'ton of cash'. The full extent of his toe-curling sales pitch was published in the Sunday Mirror today after pictures were published on the website Political Scrapbook. In it he offers punters the chance to buy his toolkit on 'How To Become Stinking RICH Online' for $197 – even though he claimed it was worth $100,000. The toolkit, he claimed, would make those who bought it '11 to 22 times more successful than the crowd as a result'. Mr Shapps boasted about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. Pictured in his sports car he wrote: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L' But he warned punters they would have to move fast because he had taken the 'difficult decision' to limit supply to just 250 copies, saying: 'I will delete the webpage and the mastercopy of this toolkit'. Mr Shapps offered his online kit to people throughout the UK and across the world from his HowToCorp business based in North West London. He wrote: 'Since owning an online business has enabled me to live in a $2m home... to drive 3 high-end luxury cars and to own and operate my own aircraft, I suppose a toolkit that exposes every secret used to build that kind of wealth should rightfully sell for say $100,000.' Mr Shapps boasts about how he made a fortune in just 30 months from his HowToCorp firm and other projects. The letter, published in 2004, featured Mr Shapps posing in his luxury sports car with the caption: 'That's me... and I'm sitting in my brandspanking-new Crossfire Convertible 3.2L (delivered Saturday July 24). It's one of the first dozen on the road here in the UK.' Tory chairman Grant Shapps faced calls to resign last week after admitting he had had a second job while working as an MP . But he revealed he and wife Belinda also own a 'wonderful Elan Turbo'. The car, he says, is 'complete with in-car DVD, SatNav and just about every other refinement you could imagine in a vehicle. Why it even has a fridge!' He also boasts about his lavish six-bedroom house in Hertfordshire and its new extension. Next to a picture of him sitting in a plane with his son, he writes: 'Everyone a hobby. Mine's flying. But buying and maintaining an aircraft (and this is my second machine) isn't cheap! 'But I just hate to rent... So I took out my pocket-book and bought a plane. That's me and my son in the cockpit. (One of us is a three-year-old with a passion for flying :)' Revelations about Mr Shapps' methods comes just days after he was branded a 'liar and a bully' for threatening a constituents with legal action for highlighting the fact he had a second job. Dean Archer, 50, said he had feared losing his family home after Mr Shapps warned he would take him to court over a Facebook post that mentioned his internet sales sideline as Michael Green. Despite the revelations David Cameron last week insisted he had full confidence in the Conservative party chairman. He said: 'Grant did have another job when he first became an MP and he declared that in the Register of Members' Interests which is what you are meant to do. 'But he obviously made a mistake by saying in some interviews that the work had stopped earlier than it had. He's put that right so I think we can put that behind him.
