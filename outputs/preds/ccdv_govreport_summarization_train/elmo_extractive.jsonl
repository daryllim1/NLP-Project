{"index": 0, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Information sharing is an integral part of the federal government’s CIP efforts. As discussed in our April testimony, a number of ISACs have been established to meet the information-sharing needs of their respective sectors, and the federal government has undertaken steps to improve CIP information sharing. Yet sector representatives have identified a number of challenges to effective information sharing. Federal law and policy emphasize the importance of information sharing to the successful protection of our nation’s critical infrastructures. The Homeland Security Act of 2002 established DHS and made the department’s Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Directorate responsible for CIP functions with a lead role for information sharing within DHS and the federal government. IAIP’s responsibilities include accessing, receiving, and analyzing law enforcement information, intelligence information, and other threat and incident information from respective agencies of federal, state, and local governments and the private sector; combining and analyzing such information to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats; and disseminating, as appropriate, information analyzed by DHS, within the department, to other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and private-sector entities. As also required by the Homeland Security Act, IAIP is responsible for (1) developing a comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of the United States and (2) recommending measures to protect the key resources and critical infrastructure of the United States in coordination with other federal agencies and in cooperation with state and local government agencies and authorities, the private sector, and other entities. Current CIP policy, described in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), defines responsibilities for DHS, sector-specific agencies, and other departments and agencies. It instructs federal departments and agencies to identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure to prevent, deter, and mitigate the effects of attacks. The Secretary of Homeland Security is assigned several responsibilities, including establishing uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and methodologies for integrating federal infrastructure protection and risk management activities within and across sectors. To ensure the coverage of critical sectors, HSPD-7 designated sector specific agencies for the critical infrastructure sectors identified. These agencies are responsible for infrastructure protection activities in their assigned sectors, which include coordinating and collaborating with relevant federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector to carry out their responsibilities and facilitating the sharing of information about physical and cyber threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, potential protective measures, and best practices. Further, the sector-specific agencies are to continue to encourage the development of information-sharing and analysis mechanisms and to support sector-coordinating mechanisms. Table 1 identifies the infrastructure sectors specified in federal policy and the related sector-specific agencies. As more fully discussed in our April testimony, ISACs were voluntarily created to provide an information sharing and analysis capability to support their members’ efforts to mitigate risk and effectively respond to adverse events, including cyber, physical, and natural events. ISACs have been established within most of the critical infrastructure sectors identified in federal policy, including those for banking and finance, chemicals and hazardous materials, drinking water and water treatment systems, emergency services, energy, food, government, information technology and telecommunications, and transportation. ISACs have also been established for other industry sectors, including real estate and research and education networking. Further, the agriculture and healthcare infrastructure sectors are continuing their efforts to establish information sharing mechanisms. Table 2 identifies the sectors with ISACs. Although their overall missions are similar, the current ISACs were established and developed based on the unique characteristics and needs of their individual sectors. They operate under different management and operational structures and, among other things, have different business models and funding mechanisms. For example, most are managed or operated as private entities, and some, such as the Water and Chemical ISACs, are part of associations that represent their sectors. Others have partnered with government agencies, such as the Telecommunications ISAC, which is a government/industry operational and collaborative body sponsored by DHS’s National Communications Systems/National Coordinating Center for Telecommunications. Different funding mechanisms used by the ISACs include fee-for-service, association sponsorship, grants, contracts, and/or voluntary or in-kind operations by ISAC participants. ISACs that use fee-for-service funding include the Financial Services, Information Technology, and Water ISACs, which offer tiered memberships with fees based on the level of service provided. Sector-specific agencies are to collaborate with the private sector and continue to encourage the development of information-sharing and analysis mechanisms. In addition, sector-specific agencies are to facilitate the sharing of information about physical and cyber threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, potential protective measures, and best practices. Some sector-specific agencies have taken steps to help the ISACs to increase their memberships and breadth of impact within their respective sectors and to improve their analytical and communications capabilities. As we discussed more specifically in our April testimony, sector-specific agencies, among other things, have Provided funds to enhance ISAC capabilities and expand membership. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency is the sector-specific agency for the water sector. It reported that for fiscal year 2004, it had issued in March 2004 a $2 million grant to the Water ISAC to enhance its capabilities—to fund 24x7 operations and to increase and support ISAC membership. In addition, the Department of the Treasury entered into a $2 million contract with the Financial Services ISAC for developing the “next generation” Financial Services ISAC by enhancing the ISAC’s capabilities and develop performance metrics. Sponsored outreach briefings to address why the private sector needs to partner with the federal government. For example, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee, and the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council are sponsoring regional outreach briefings that address why the private sector needs to partner with the federal government to improve its security. In addition, in December 2003, DHS hosted a 2-day CIP retreat with ISAC representatives, sector coordinators, and high-level DHS and White House Homeland Security Council officials. Participants discussed the needs, roles, and responsibilities of public- and private-sector entities related to information sharing and analysis, incident coordination and response activities, critical infrastructure information requests, and level of DHS funding. Assisted infrastructure sectors in organizing sector-wide activities and establishing ISACs. For example, last summer, DHS, the Department of Agriculture, and HHS’ Food and Drug Administration initiated efforts to organize the agriculture and food critical infrastructure sectors to raise awareness, coordinate, and improve security efforts. In addition to the efforts listed above, DHS officials stated that they are providing funding for tabletop exercises, including for the Financial Services, Telecommunications, and Electricity Sector ISACs. The ISACs and the series of ISAC Council white papers confirmed that a number of challenges remain to the successful establishment and operation of ISACs and their partnership with DHS and the other sector-specific agencies. The ISACs and the ISAC Council identified challenges that would require federal action. Some of the more significant challenges identified were the following: Government agencies and the ISACs need to build trusted relationships between them to facilitate information sharing. In some cases, establishing such relationships may be difficult because sector-specific agencies may also have a regulatory role. The federal government and the private sector should share information on incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities. Most ISACs reported that they believed they were providing appropriate information to the government but, while noting improvements, they still had concerns with the information being provided to them by DHS and/or their sector-specific agencies. These concerns included the limited quantity of information and the need for more specific, timely, and actionable information. In its recent white papers, the ISAC Council also has identified a number of potential barriers to information sharing between the private sector and the government. These included the sensitivity of the information (such as law enforcement information), legal limits on disclosure (such as Privacy Act limitations on disclosure of personally identifiable information), and contractual and business limits on how and when information is disclosed (e.g., the Financial Services ISAC does not allow any governmental or law enforcement access to its database). The Council also emphasized that perhaps the greatest barriers to information sharing stem from practical and business considerations in that, although important, the benefits of sharing information are often difficult to discern, while the risks and costs of sharing are direct and foreseeable. The roles of the various government and private-sector entities involved in protecting critical infrastructures must continue to be identified and defined. In particular, officials for several ISACs wanted a better definition of DHS’s role with respect to them. The ISAC Council also identified the need for DHS to establish the goals of its directorates and the relationships of these directorates with the private sector. The Council also wants clarification of the roles of other federal agencies, state agencies, and other entities—such as the National Infrastructure Advisory Council. Government funding is needed. Ten of the ISACs we contacted emphasized the importance of government funding for purposes including creating the ISAC, supporting operations, increasing membership, developing metrics, and providing for additional capabilities. Private-sector analytical efforts should not be overlooked and must be integrated into the federal processes for a more complete understanding. The private sector understands its processes, assets, and operations best and can be relied upon to provide the required private-sector subject matter expertise. DHS has taken a number of actions to implement the public/private partnership called for by federal CIP policy. However, DHS has not yet developed a plan for how it will carry out its information sharing responsibilities, including efforts to address the challenges identified by the ISACs and the ISAC Council. In addition, DHS has not developed internal policies and procedures to help ensure effective information sharing by the many entities within the department that collect and analyze information that may impact the security of our nation’s critical infrastructure. It is essential for DHS to develop this plan, along with internal policies and procedures, to establish effective information-sharing relationships both within DHS and with other federal agencies and infrastructure sectors. Although DHS has taken a number of actions to develop relationships with the private sector and enhance information sharing capabilities, it has not developed a plan that describes how it will carry out its information-sharing responsibilities and/or how it will address the many identified challenges that exist in building a public/private information-sharing partnership. Development of a plan could improve information sharing by clarifying roles and responsibilities and clearly articulating actions to address the challenges that remain, including consideration of appropriate incentives for nonfederal entities to increase information sharing with the federal government, increase sector participation, and/or perform other specific tasks to protect the critical infrastructure. In addition, soliciting input and feedback from the ISACs, sector coordinators, and sector-specific agencies in developing the plan could help DHS to ensure that the challenges identified by the ISACs and the ISAC Council are appropriately considered. According to DHS officials, the department intends to develop a plan (referred to as a “roadmap”) that documents the current information-sharing relationships among DHS, the sectors and their ISACs, and other agencies; goals for improving that information-sharing relationship; and methods for measuring the progress in the improvement. According to one official, the plan will define the roles and responsibilities of DHS, the ISACs, and other entities, including a potential overlap of ISAC-related responsibilities between IAIP and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). Further, the official indicated that, in developing such a plan, DHS would consider issues raised by the ISACs and the ISAC Council. This official indicated that a specific time frame for completing the plan had not yet been established but that DHS intends to develop a time frame this summer. DHS has established functions within the department to support the ISACs and other CIP efforts. IAIP, as the DHS component directly responsible for CIP activities, carries out many of these functions. The Infrastructure Coordination Division within IAIP plays a key role in coordinating with the ISACs concerning information sharing. Nonetheless, ISACs may interact with multiple components of the department. For example, the ISACs may discuss cyber issues with the National Cyber Security Division and/or with the Homeland Security Operations Center when reporting incidents. Further, according to DHS officials, TSA, within the department’s Border and Transportation Security Directorate, is working with organizations in the private sector to establish information-sharing relationships. For example, Surface Transportation ISAC analysts stated that they have a good working relationship with TSA, and TSA’s Operations Center has office space designated for them. In addition, the Infrastructure Coordination Division is in the process of staffing analysts who are responsible for working with each critical infrastructure sector. The analysts would serve as the primary points of contact within DHS for the sectors and would address information sharing, coordination, infrastructure protection, and other issues raised by the sectors. According to a DHS official, the department does not intend to establish a single point of contact for ISACs within the department. Rather, the department plans to develop policies and procedures to ensure effective coordination and sharing of ISAC-provided information among the appropriate DHS components. At the time of our review, DHS had not developed those policies and procedures and had no specific time frame for their completion. Because of the many DHS components potentially interacting with critical infrastructure sectors, establishment of policies and procedures could help DHS ensure that information is effectively and efficiently shared within the IAIP Directorate and among DHS components, as well as with other federal agencies and infrastructure sectors, by clarifying roles, responsibilities, and processes. Although DHS has taken a number of actions to establish and improve information sharing relationships among entities within the infrastructure sectors and between the infrastructure sectors and the federal government, a number of challenges remain that are barriers to developing effective public-private partnerships. The ISACs and other stakeholders, including sector-specific agencies and sector coordinators, could benefit from an overall DHS strategy, as well as specific guidance, that clearly describes their roles, responsibilities, relationships, and expectations. In developing such a strategy, it will also be important to consider input from all stakeholders to help ensure that a comprehensive and trusted information-sharing process is established. DHS has also not yet developed the internal policies and procedures needed to ensure that appropriate information sharing occurs within the department, which could affect its overall ability to perform analysis and disseminate critical information about incidents, vulnerabilities, or threats. To help improve the effectiveness of DHS’s information-sharing efforts with the ISACs and others, we recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security direct officials within the IAIP Directorate to take the following two actions: Proceed with and establish milestones for the development of an information-sharing plan that includes (1) a clear description of the roles and responsibilities of DHS, the ISACs, the sector coordinators, and the sector-specific agencies and (2) actions designed to address information-sharing challenges. Efforts to develop this plan should include soliciting feedback from the ISACs, sector coordinators, and sector-specific agencies to help ensure that challenges identified by the ISACs and the ISAC Council are appropriately considered in the final plan. Considering the roles, responsibilities, and actions established in the information-sharing plan, develop appropriate DHS policies and procedures for interacting with ISACs, sector coordinators, and sector-specific agencies and for coordination and information sharing within the IAIP Directorate (such as the National Cyber Security Division and Infrastructure Coordination Division) and other DHS components that may interact with the ISACs, including TSA. We received written comments on a draft of this report from DHS, HHS, and the Department of the Treasury (see apps. II, III, and IV, respectively). In DHS’s response, a representative from DHS’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer stated that the report generally provides an accurate analysis of the current sector ISAC landscape. In addition, the director provided planned actions to address the recommendations identified in this report. HHS’s Acting Principal Deputy Inspector General stated that the department had no comments. In Treasury’s response, the Under Secretary for Domestic Finance stated that the department agreed with our findings. These departments also provided technical comments, which were incorporated into the report, as appropriate. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency provided separate technical comments, which were incorporated into this report, as appropriate. The Departments of Agriculture and Energy reviewed a draft of this report and responded by stating that they had no comments. As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the report date. At that time, we will send copies of this report to other interested congressional committees, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the heads of the agencies discussed in this report. We also will make copies available to others upon request. In addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO Web site at http://www.gao.gov.

Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) activities that are called for in federal policy and law are intended to enhance the security of the cyber and physical public and private infrastructures that are essential to our nation’s security, economic security, and public health and safety. As our reliance on these infrastructures increases, so do the potential threats and attacks that could disrupt critical systems and operations. Effective information-sharing partnerships between industry sectors and government can contribute to CIP efforts. Federal awareness of the importance of securing the nation’s critical infrastructures—and the federal government’s strategy to encourage cooperative efforts among state and local governments and the private sector to protect these infrastructures—have been evolving since the mid- 1990s. Federal policy continues to emphasize the importance of the ISACs and their information-sharing functions. In addition, federal policy established specific responsibilities for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal agencies involved with the private sector in CIP. The ISACs themselves, although they have similar missions, were developed to serve the unique needs of the sectors they represent, and they operate under different business models and funding mechanisms. Federal policy has encouraged the voluntary creation of Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) to facilitate the private sector’s participation in CIP by serving as mechanisms for gathering and analyzing information and sharing it among the infrastructure sectors and between the private sector and government. This testimony discusses the management and operational structures used by ISACs, federal efforts to interact with and support the ISACs, and challenges to and successful practices for ISACs’ establishment, operation, and partnerships with the federal government. According to ISAC representatives and a council that represents many of them, a number of challenges to their successful establishment, operation, and partnership with DHS and other federal agencies remain. These challenges include increasing the percentage of entities within each sector that are members of its ISAC; building trusted relationships and processes to facilitate information sharing; overcoming barriers to information sharing, clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the various government and private sector entities that are involved in protecting critical infrastructures; and funding ISAC operations and activities. According to a DHS official, these issues are being considered, and the department is developing a plan that will document the current information-sharing relationships among DHS, the ISACs, and other agencies; goals for improving those information- sharing relationships; and methods for measuring progress toward these goals.

Chairmen and Members of the Subcommittees: I am pleased to be here today to discuss the status of private-sector information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) and their efforts to help protect our nation’s critical infrastructures. Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) activities called for in federal policy and law are intended to enhance the security of cyber and physical, public and private infrastructures that are essential to national security, national economic security, or national public health and safety. Beginning with Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63), issued in May 1998, federal policy has encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs to facilitate private-sector participation and serve as mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately sanitizing and disseminating information to and from infrastructure sectors and the federal government. Subsequent federal CIP policy, including several national strategies, has continued to emphasize the importance of the ISACs and their information-sharing functions.Further, CIP policy has established specific responsibilities for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and other federal agencies with respect to public/private collaboration to help protect private infrastructure sectors. In my testimony today, I will discuss the management and operational structures used by the ISACs, including their estimated sector participation, business and funding models, and information sharing and analysis mechanisms. I will then discuss activities by DHS and other federal agencies with responsibilities for specific infrastructure sectors to interact and support the ISACs. Lastly, I will discuss some of the ISAC- identified challenges to and successful practices for their establishment, operation, and partnership with the federal government. As agreed, this testimony includes initial results of our ongoing analysis of private-sector ISACs, which was requested by your subcommittees. In conducting this work, we contacted officials from the 15 different ISAC organizations that had been established at the time of our review: Chemical, Electricity, Energy, Emergency Management and Response, Financial Services, Food, Information Technology, Multi-State, Public Transit, Real Estate, Research and Education Networking, Surface Transportation, Telecommunications, Highway, and Water. Through structured interviews with these officials, we obtained and analyzed information to describe the ISACs’ current organization and operational models, funding mechanisms, sector representation and membership criteria, as well as their challenges and successful practices in establishing effective information-sharing relationships within their sectors and with the federal government. We also contacted officials of the Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council to discuss their efforts to establish an ISAC for the healthcare sector. Further, we contacted officials of the ISAC Council, which was created by 11 ISACs to address common issues, and we obtained and analyzed its series of white papers on a range of ISAC- related issues and challenges. Within the federal government, we obtained and analyzed information on efforts to work with the private sector by DHS and other agencies assigned responsibilities for specific industry sectors, including the Departments of Agriculture, Energy, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury and the Environmental Protection Agency. We did not validate the accuracy of the data provided by the ISACs, DHS, or other agencies. We performed our work from November 2003 to April 2004, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. cooperative efforts with state and local governments and the private sector to protect the systems that are essential to the minimum operations of the economy and the government from physical and cyber attack. In 2002, the Homeland Security Act created the Department of Homeland Security, which was given responsibility for developing a national plan; recommending measures to protect the critical infrastructure; and collecting, analyzing, and disseminating information to government and private-sector entities to deter, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks. More recently, HSPD-7, issued in December 2003, defined federal responsibilities for critical infrastructure protection, superseding PDD 63. Federal awareness of the importance of securing our nation’s critical infrastructures has continued to evolve since the mid-1990s. Over the years, a variety of working groups has been formed, special reports written, federal policies issued, and organizations created to address the issues that have been raised. Key documents that have shaped the development of the federal government’s CIP policy include: Presidential Decision Directive 63 (PDD 63), The Homeland Security Act of 2002, The National Strategies for Homeland Security, to Secure Cyberspace and for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets, and Homeland Security Presidential Directives 7 (HSPD-7) and 9 (HSPD-9). Presidential Decision Directive 63 Established an Initial CIP Strategy In 1998, the President issued PDD 63, which described a strategy for cooperative efforts by government and the private sector to protect the physical and cyber-based systems essential to the minimum operations of the economy and the government. PDD 63 called for a range of actions that were intended to improve federal agency security programs, improve the nation’s ability to detect and respond to serious computer-based and physical attacks, and establish a partnership between the government and the private sector. Although it was superseded in December 2003 by HSPD-7, PDD 63 provided the foundation for the development of the current sector-based CIP approach. Infrastructure Protection Center (NIPC), an organization within the FBI, which was expanded to address national-level threat assessment, warning, vulnerability, and law enforcement investigation and response. To ensure the coverage of critical sectors, PDD 63 identified eight infrastructures and five functions. For each of the infrastructures and functions, the directive designated lead federal agencies, referred to as sector liaisons, to work with their counterparts in the private sector, referred to as sector coordinators. Among other responsibilities, PDD 63 stated that sector liaisons should identify and access economic incentives to encourage sector information sharing and other desired behavior. To facilitate private-sector participation, PDD 63 also encouraged the voluntary creation of information sharing and analysis centers (ISACs) to serve as mechanisms for gathering, analyzing, and appropriately sanitizing and disseminating information to and from infrastructure sectors and the federal government through NIPC. PDD 63 also suggested several key ISAC activities to effectively gather, analyze, and disseminate information—activities that could improve the security postures of the individual sectors and provide an improved level of communication within and across sectors and all levels of government. These activities are: establishing baseline statistics and patterns on the various infrastructures; serving as a clearinghouse for information within and among the various sectors; providing a library of historical data for use by the private sector and government, and reporting private-sector incidents to NIPC. The Homeland Security Act of 2002, signed by the President on November 25, 2002, established DHS. To help accomplish its mission, the act established five undersecretaries, among other entities, with responsibility over directorates for management, science and technology, information analysis and infrastructure protection, border and transportation security, and emergency preparedness and response. The act made the Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection (IAIP) Directorate within the department responsible for CIP functions and transferred to it the functions, personnel, assets, and liabilities of several existing organizations with CIP responsibilities, including NIPC (other than the Computer Investigations and Operations Section). governments and the private sector, and for combining and analyzing such information to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats. IAIP is also tasked with coordinating with other federal agencies to administer the Homeland Security Advisory System to provide specific warning information along with advice on appropriate protective measures and countermeasures. Further, IAIP is responsible for disseminating, as appropriate, information analyzed by DHS, within the department, to other federal agencies, state and local government agencies, and private-sector entities. Moreover, as stated in the Homeland Security Act of 2002, IAIP is responsible for (1) developing a comprehensive national plan for securing the key resources and critical infrastructure of the United States and (2) recommending measures to protect the key resources and critical infrastructure of the United States in coordination with other federal agencies and in cooperation with state and local government agencies and authorities, the private sector, and other entities. The National Strategy for Homeland Security identifies information sharing and systems as one foundation for evaluating homeland security investments across the federal government. It also identifies initiatives to enable critical infrastructure information sharing and to integrate sharing across state and local government, private industry, and citizens. Consistent with the original intent of PDD 63, the National Strategy for Homeland Security states that, in many cases, sufficient incentives exist in the private market for addressing the problems of CIP. However, the strategy also discusses the need to use all available policy tools to protect the health, safety, or well-being of the American people. It mentions federal grant programs to assist state and local efforts, legislation to create incentives for the private sector, and, in some cases, regulation. expected to play an increasingly important role in the National Cyberspace Security Response System and the overall missions of homeland security. In addition, the cyberspace strategy identifies DHS as the central coordinator for cyberspace efforts and requires it to work closely with the ISACs to ensure that they receive timely and threat and vulnerability data that can be acted on and to coordinate voluntary contingency planning efforts. The strategy reemphasizes that the federal government encourages the private sector to continue to establish ISACs and, further, to enhance the analytical capabilities of existing ISACs. Moreover, the strategy stresses the need to improve and enhance public/private information sharing about cyber attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities and to encourage broader information sharing on cybersecurity among nongovernmental organizations with significant computing resources. The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace also states that the market is to provide the major impetus to improve cybersecurity and that regulation will not become a primary means of securing cyberspace. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets provides a statement of national policy to remain committed to protecting critical infrastructures and key assets from physical attacks. It outlines three key objectives to focus the national protection effort: (1) identifying and assuring the protection of the most critical assets, systems, and functions; (2) assuring the protection of infrastructures that face an imminent threat; and (3) pursuing collaborative measures and initiatives to assure the protection of other potential targets. The National Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets also states that further government leadership and intense collaboration between public- and private-sector stakeholders is needed to create a more effective and efficient information-sharing process to enable our core protective missions. Some of the specific initiatives include defining protection-related information requirements and establishing effective, efficient information-sharing processes; promoting the development and operation of critical sector ISACs, including developing advanced analytical capabilities; improving processes for domestic threat data collection, analysis, and dissemination to state and local governments and private industry; and completing implementation of the Homeland Security Advisory System. The National Strategy for the Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key Assets reiterates that additional regulatory directives and mandates should be necessary only in instances where the market forces are insufficient to prompt the necessary investments to protect critical infrastructures and key assets. In December 2003, the President issued HSPD-7, which established a national policy for federal departments and agencies to identify and prioritize critical infrastructure and key resources and to protect them from terrorist attack. It superseded PDD 63. HSPD-7 defines responsibilities for DHS, sector-specific agencies (formerly referred to as lead agencies) that are responsible for addressing specific critical infrastructure sectors, and other departments and agencies. It instructs federal departments and agencies to identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of critical infrastructure to prevent, deter, and mitigate the effects of attacks. The Secretary of Homeland Security is assigned several responsibilities, including coordinating the national effort to enhance critical infrastructure protection; identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating the protection of critical infrastructure, emphasizing protection against catastrophic health effects or mass casualties; establishing uniform policies, approaches, guidelines, and methodologies for integrating federal infrastructure protection and risk management activities within and across sectors; and serving as the focal point for cyberspace security activities, including analysis, warning, information sharing, vulnerability reduction, mitigation, and recovery efforts for critical infrastructure information systems. To ensure the coverage of critical sectors, HSPD-7 designated sector- specific agencies for the critical infrastructure sectors identified in the National Strategy for Homeland Security (see table 1). These agencies are responsible for infrastructure protection activities in their assigned sectors, which include coordinating and collaborating with relevant federal agencies, state and local governments, and the private sector to carry out their responsibilities; conducting or facilitating vulnerability assessments of the sector; encouraging the use of risk management strategies to protect against and mitigate the effects of attacks against the critical infrastructure; identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating the protection of critical infrastructure; facilitating the sharing of information about physical and cyber threats, vulnerabilities, incidents, potential protective measures, and best practices; and reporting to DHS on an annual basis on their activities to meet these responsibilities. Further, the sector-specific agencies are to continue to encourage the development of information-sharing and analysis mechanisms and to support sector-coordinating mechanisms. HSPD-7 does not suggest any specific ISAC activities. addressing specific critical infrastructure sectors, and other departments and agencies. It instructs federal departments and agencies to protect the agriculture and food system from terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies by identifying and prioritizing sector-critical infrastructure and key resources for establishing protection requirements, developing awareness and early warning capabilities to recognize threats, mitigating vulnerabilities at critical production and processing nodes, enhancing screening procedures for domestic and imported products, and enhancing response and recovery procedures. In addition, the Secretary of Homeland Security, in coordination with the Secretaries of Agriculture, Health and Human Services, and other appropriate federal department and agencies, are assigned responsibilities including expanding and continuing vulnerability assessments of the agriculture and food sectors and working with appropriate private-sector entities to establish an effective information-sharing and analysis mechanism for agriculture and food. objectives and milestones, sets timeframes for achieving objectives, and establishes performance measures; developing fully productive information-sharing relationships within the federal government and among the federal government and state and local governments and the private sector; improving the federal government’s capabilities to analyze incident, threat, and vulnerability information obtained from numerous sources and share appropriate timely, useful warnings and other information concerning both cyber and physical threats to federal entities, state and local governments, and the private sector; and providing appropriate incentives for nonfederal entities to increase information sharing with the federal government. PDD 63 encouraged the voluntary creation of ISACs and suggested some possible activities, as discussed earlier; however, their actual design and functions were left to the private sector, along with their relationships with the federal government. HSPD-7 continues to encourage the development of information-sharing mechanisms and does not suggest specific ISAC activities. As a result, the ISACs have been designed to perform their missions based on the unique characteristics and needs of their individual sectors and, although their overall missions are similar, they have different characteristics. They were created to provide an information sharing and analysis capability for members of their respective infrastructure sectors in order to support efforts to mitigate risk and provide effective response to adverse events, including cyber, physical, and natural events. In addition, the ISACs have taken several steps to improve their capabilities and the services they provide to their respective sectors. The ISACs have developed diverse management structures and operations to meet the requirements of their respective critical infrastructure sectors. To fulfill their missions, they have been established using various business models, diverse funding mechanisms, and multiple communication methods. Technology, Public Transit, Real Estate, Surface Transportation, Highway, and Water ISACs. Many are established as part of an association that represents a segment of or an entire critical infrastructure sector. For example, the Association of Metropolitan Water Authorities manages the contract for the Water ISAC and the American Chemistry Council manages and operates the Chemical ISAC through its CHEMTRAC. In addition, the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC), a nonprofit corporation that promotes electric system reliability and security, operates the Electricity Sector ISAC using internal expertise. The legal structure of the ISACs continues to evolve. The Financial Services ISAC has evolved from a limited liability corporation in 1999 to a 501(c)6 non-stock corporation and is managed by a board of directors that is comprised of representatives from the Financial Services ISAC’s members. According to the Financial Services ISAC Board, the change to be a 501(c)6 non-stock corporation, as mentioned above, was made to simplify the membership agreement and to make the process for obtaining public funding easier. The Energy ISAC also changed from a limited liability corporation to a 501(c)3 nonprofit charitable organization to eliminate membership barriers. Also, government agencies have partnered with the private sector to operate certain ISACs. For example, DHS’s National Communications Systems/ National Coordinating Center (NCC) for Telecommunications sponsors the Telecommunications ISAC, which is a government/industry operational and collaborative body. DHS provides for the Telecommunications ISAC facilities, tools and systems, the NCC manager, and the 24x7 watch operations staff. The private sector provides representatives who have access to key corporate personnel and other resources. In addition, DHS’s United States Fire Administration operates the Emergency Management and Response ISAC. New York State, through its Office of Cyber Security and Critical Infrastructure Coordination, is coordinating efforts of the Multi-state ISAC. The New York State Office of Cyber Security and Critical Infrastructure Coordination is currently studying best practices and lessons learned to assist in developing a structure that will include representation by member states. Six of the ISACs included in our study use contractors to perform their day-to-day operations. According to an Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) official, they chose a contractor to operate the Water ISAC because the contractor had the appropriate expertise. In addition, the contractor’s personnel had government clearances and the ability to operate a secure communication system and facility. In addition, ISACs use contractors to supplement their operations. For example, a formal contract provides for the daily staffing and performance of the Emergency Management and Response ISAC’s tasks. It chose this model because of federal requirements and the shortage of positions for federal full-time employees at the United States Fire Administration. The Telecommunications ISAC contracted for analysts to operate its 24 x 7 watch operations under the management of a government official. ISACs also differ in the nature of the hazards that they consider: cyber, physical, or all hazards (including natural events such as hurricanes). For example, during events of the power outage in August 2003 and Hurricane Isabel in September 2003, the Financial Services ISAC was contacted by DHS to determine the Banking and Finance sector’s preparedness and the impact of those events. However, the Multi-state ISAC will remain focused on cyber threats because other state organizations are in place to address physical and natural disaster events. that cost is not a deterrent to membership and that the ISAC’s coverage of its sector is extensive, the Financial Services ISAC recently, as part of its next-generation ISAC effort, shifted to a tiered fee-for-service approach. It offers five levels of service that vary in cost—Basic (no charge), Core ($750 per year), Premier ($10,000 per year), Gold ($25,000 per year), and Platinum ($50,000)—for ascending levels of information and analytical capabilities. In addition, there is a partner-level license agreement for select industry associations ($10,000) for distribution to eligible association members of Urgent and Crisis Alerts. For example, the Information Technology ISAC recently started to work on a tiered basis with fees set annually at $40,000; $25,000; $5,000; $1,000; and free. The Water ISAC also uses a tiered approach, with membership fees ranging from $7,500 to $750 annually. The Surface Transportation ISAC assesses an annual fee from its Class I railroad members of approximately $7,500. Some industry associations that operate ISACs fund them from budgets. For example, the North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) funds the Electricity Sector ISAC, and the American Trucking Association funds the Highway ISAC from their budgets. The American Chemistry Council fully funds the Chemical ISAC through the previously existing Chemical Transportation Emergency Center, known as CHEMTRAC. The ten trade associations that are members of it fund the Real Estate ISAC. In addition, some ISACs receive funding from the federal government for such purposes as helping to start operations, funding memberships, and providing expanded capabilities. Examples include the following: The Public Transit ISAC initially received a $1.2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to begin operations. Members pay no an annual fee and there are no membership requirements from the association that started the ISAC—the American Public Transportation Association. For FY 2004, the Water ISAC received a $2 million grant from EPA to cover annual operating costs, including the expansion of memberships to smaller utilities. The Financial Services ISAC received $2 million dollars from the Department of the Treasury to enhance its capabilities, including technology to broaden membership service. The Highway ISAC received initial funding from DHS’s Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to start the ISAC. The Energy ISAC received federal grants to assist entities within its separate sectors to be members. DHS provides funding for the operation of the Telecommunications ISAC that is combined with in-kind services provided by the corporate participants. DHS also fully operates the Emergency Management and Response ISAC. States also provide funding for ISACs. For example, the Multi-state ISAC is funded by and functions as part of the New York State Cyber Security Analysis Center. In addition, the Research and Education Networking ISAC is supported by Indiana University. Sharing mechanisms—ISACs use various methods to share information with their members, other ISACs, and the federal government. For example, they generally provide their members access to electronic information via e-mail and Web sites. For example, the Chemical ISAC members receive e-mail alerts and warnings in addition to the information that is posted to the ISAC’s Web site. The Highway ISAC provides members on its Web site with links to IT resources. Some ISACs also provide secure members-only access to information on their Web sites. For example, the Financial Services ISAC’s Web site offers multiple capabilities for members at the premier level and above, including, among other things, access to news, white papers, best practices, and contacts. The Energy ISAC offers its members access to a secure Web site. In addition, some ISACs hold conference calls for their members. For example, the Chemical ISAC holds biweekly conference calls with DHS. The Financial Services ISAC also conducts threat intelligence conference calls every two weeks for premier members and above with input from Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC) and DHS. These calls discuss physical and cyber threats, vulnerabilities and incidents that have occurred during the previous two weeks, and they provide suggestions on what may be coming. The Financial Services ISAC is capable of organizing crisis conference calls within an hour of the notification of a Crisis Alert, and it hosts regular biweekly threat conference calls for remediation of vulnerabilities (viruses, patches). Information Network (CWIN). The Financial Services ISAC also sponsors twice yearly members’ only conferences to learn and share information. According to the ISAC Council, its membership possesses an outreach and connectivity capability to approximately 65 percent of the U.S. private critical infrastructure. However, the ISACs use various matrices to define their respective sectors’ participation in their activities. For example, the Banking and Finance sector has estimated that there are more than 25,000 financial services firms in the United States. Of those, according to the Financial Services ISAC Board, roughly 33 percent receive Urgent and Crisis Alerts through license agreements with sector associations; these firms account for the vast majority of total commercial bank assets, the majority of assets under management, and the majority of securities/ investment bank transactions that are handled by the sector, but less than half the sector’s insurance assets. According to an American Public Transportation Association official, the Public Transit ISAC covers a little less than 5 percent of the public transit agencies; however, those agencies handle about 60 to 70 percent of the total public transit ridership. Further, according to NERC officials, virtually all members of NERC are members of the Electricity Sector ISAC. As for the Energy ISAC, officials stated that its 80-plus members represent approximately 85 percent of the energy industry. Membership in the Information Technology ISAC also represents 85 to 90 percent of the industry, including assets of Internet equipment hardware, software, and security providers. For other ISACs, such as Chemical and Real Estate, officials stated that it is difficult to determine the percentage of the sector that is included. Table 2 provides a summary of the characteristics of the ISACs that we included in our review. In addition to these ISACs, the Healthcare sector is continuing to organize, including efforts to establish an ISAC. According to DHS officials, the Emergency Law Enforcement ISAC that was formally operated by the NIPC and transferred to IAIP is not currently staffed and will be considered in current efforts to organize the Emergency Services sector.

Depends on DHS for threat analysis. 2-way communications network and Web site Conference calls with top executives from various sectors as needed. As discussed earlier, federal CIP policy establishes the position of sector coordinator for identified critical infrastructure sectors to initiate and build cooperative relationships across an entire infrastructure sector. In most cases, sector coordinators have played an important role in the development of their respective infrastructure sectors’ ISACs. In many cases the sector coordinator also manages or operates the ISAC. The North American Electric Reliability Council, as sector coordinator for the electricity segment of the energy sector, operates the Electricity Sector ISAC. The Association of American Railroads, as a sector coordinator for the transportation sector, manages the Surface Transportation ISAC. The Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, as the sector coordinator for the water and wastewater sector, manages the Water ISAC. In addition, regarding the telecommunications ISAC, sector coordinators participate as members of the ISAC. For example, the Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association, the United States Telecom Association, and the Telecommunications Industry Association are all members of the NCC, which operates the telecommunications ISAC. In the case of the Financial Services ISAC, no formal relationship exists between the Banking and Finance Sector Coordinator, the Financial Services Sector Coordinating Council, and the ISAC; however, according to Financial Services ISAC officials, there is a good relationship between them. Other ISACs were created and are operated without a formal sector coordinator in place, including the Chemical, Emergency Management and Response, and Food ISACs. Eleven ISACs created an ISAC Council to work on various operational, process, and other common issues to effectively analyze and disseminate information and, where possible, to leverage the work of the entire ISAC community. The ISACs initiated this effort without federal sponsorship. Currently, the participating ISACs include Chemical, Electricity, Energy, Financial Services, Information Technology, Public Transit, Surface Transportation, Telecommunications, Highway, and Water. In addition, the Multi-state and Research and Education Networking ISACs are participants. In February 2004, the council issued eight white papers to reflect the collective analysis of its members and to cover a broad set of issues and challenges, including Government/Private-Sector Relations.

Reach of Major ISACs. Describes and identifies the degree of outreach that the ISACs have achieved into the U.S. economy. As of September 2003, the ISAC Council estimated that the ISACs had reached approximately 65 percent of the critical infrastructures they represent. Vetting and Trust. Discusses the processes for sharing information and the need to develop trust relationships among individual ISAC members and among the various ISACs. As outlined in HSPD-7 and presented in table 1, DHS and other federal agencies are designated as sector-specific agencies for the critical infrastructure sectors identified. In addition, DHS is responsible for coordinating the overall national effort to enhance the protection of the critical infrastructure and key resources of the United States and has established organizational structures to address its CIP and information- sharing responsibilities. DHS and the sector-specific agencies have undertaken a number of efforts to address the public/private partnership that is called for by federal CIP policy, and they continue to work on their cooperation and interaction with the ISACs and with each other. specific agencies to implement the public/private partnership called for by federal CIP policy. DHS has established functions within the department to support the ISACs and other CIP efforts. IAIP, as the DHS component directly responsible for CIP activities, carries out many of these functions. The Infrastructure Coordination Division within IAIP plays a key role in coordinating with the ISACs concerning information sharing. Nonetheless, ISACs may interact with multiple components of the department. For example, the ISACs may discuss cyber issues with the National Cyber Security Division. According to a DHS official, the department does not intend to establish a single point of contact for ISACs within the department. Rather, the department plans to develop policies and procedures to ensure effective coordination and sharing of ISAC contact information among the appropriate DHS components. In addition, the Infrastructure Coordination Division is in the process of staffing analysts who are responsible for working with each critical infrastructure sector. The analysts would serve as the primary point of contact for the sectors and would address information sharing, coordination, information protection, and other issues raised by the sectors. Further, according to DHS officials, TSA, within the department’s Border and Transportation Security Directorate, is working with organizations in the private sector to establish information-sharing relationships. For example, Surface Transportation ISAC analysts stated that they have a good working relationship with TSA, and TSA’s Operations Center has office space designated for them. In addition, other DHS actions include the following: Last summer, DHS, the Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initiated efforts to organize the agriculture and food critical infrastructure sectors to raise awareness and improve security efforts. An introductory conference was held with about 100 leading sector corporations and associations to make the business case for participating in CIP efforts, including the importance of enhancing security and sharing information within the sectors. sharing and analysis, incident coordination and response activities, critical infrastructure information requests, and level of DHS funding. During this retreat, DHS participated in the first meeting of the Operational Clarity and Improvement Task Group, which was formed by the ISAC Council and sector coordinators to address the need for a common conceptual framework and to clarify current and future efforts to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure. In January, DHS’s IAIP Directorate held a 2-day conference to describe the information it is analyzing and the use of that information in the partnership with the private sector to discuss information sharing between the federal government and the private sector. In February, the department established the Protected Critical Infrastructure Information (PCII) Program, which enables the private sector to voluntarily submit infrastructure information to the government. DHS’s IAIP Directorate is responsible for receiving submissions, determining if the information qualifies for protection and, if it is validated, sharing it with authorized entities for use as specified in the Critical Infrastructure Information Act of 2002. In addition to the efforts listed above, DHS officials stated that they provide funding to some of the ISACs. For example, DHS has agreed to fund tabletop exercises for the Financial Services, Telecommunications, and Electricity Sector ISACs. DHS anticipates that the tabletop exercises will be completed by August 2004. Also, DHS expects to fund a cross- sector tabletop exercise. According to the Financial Services ISAC, funding for their tabletop exercise is $250,000. Another effort that DHS has undertaken is to maintain regular contact with the ISACs. For example, a DHS analyst specializing in the chemical sector stated that the Chemical ISAC is in daily contact with DHS and that it participates in DHS-sponsored biweekly threat meetings. The department also conducts weekly conference calls with several ISACs, other DHS components, and private-sector organizations to discuss threats and viruses. best practices. Another directive, HSPD-9, establishes a national policy to defend the agriculture and food system against terrorist attacks, major disasters, and other emergencies. Some sector-specific agencies have taken steps to help the ISACs to increase their memberships and breadth of impact within their respective sectors and to improve their analytical and communications capabilities. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). As noted earlier, EPA is the sector-specific agency for the water sector. According to EPA officials, its Office of Water (Water Security Division), which has been designated as the lead for drinking water and wastewater CIP efforts, is currently revising EPA’s Office of Homeland Security’s Strategic Plan. In addition, the division is working on a General Strategic Plan, to identify measurable goals and objectives and determine how the division will accomplish that work. Further, these officials stated that for fiscal year 2004, EPA issued a $2 million grant to the Water ISAC to enhance its capabilities, for example, to fund 24x7 operations and to increase and support ISAC membership. They also stated that EPA issued $50 million in grants to assist the largest drinking water utilities in conducting vulnerability assessments. There are also state grants to build communications networks for disseminating information, particularly to smaller utility companies. EPA’s Water Security Division also makes publicly available various resources related to water security including, among other things, emergency response guidelines, risk assessment and vulnerability assessment methodologies, and a security product guide. The division has also developed a “Vulnerability Assessment Factsheet” that gives utility companies additional guidance on vulnerability assessments. Moreover, the Water Security Division holds biweekly conference calls with water associations to promote communications between EPA and the private sector, and it provides EPA publications and other information to the Water ISAC through e-mail distribution lists. In addition, the division has 10 regional offices that work with the states. $2 million grant from Treasury to the ISAC for developing the “next generation” Financial Services ISAC. The one-time grant was earmarked for enhancing the ISAC’s capabilities. Regarding interaction with the Financial Services ISAC, Treasury informally shares high-level threat and incident information with the sector through the ISAC. The department also chairs the Financial and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC), a group of regulators who coordinate regulatory efforts to improve the reliability and security of financial systems. This group has done a number of things to raise awareness and improve the reliability of the institutions. For example, under the sponsorship of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, there are regional outreach briefings that address why the private sector needs to partner with the federal government to improve its security. Moreover, FBIIC has sponsored the 3,600 priority telecommunications circuits for financial institutions under the National Communications System’s Telecommunications Service Priority and Government Emergency Telecommunications Service programs. Department of Energy (DOE). As the sector-specific agency for the Energy and Electricity sectors, DOE’s Office of Energy Assurance is responsible for fulfilling the roles of critical infrastructure identification, prioritization, and protection for the energy sector, which includes the production, refining, and distribution of oil and gas, and electric power—except for commercial nuclear power facilities. However, DOE does not address situational threats such as natural disasters or power outages with its ISACs because, in part, the ISACs are determining whether it is their role to address these types of threats. Information sharing with the ISACs is an informal process, and no written policy exists. For example, DOE is collecting threat information related to hackers and computer security, but the department is not disseminating it to the ISACs or to private industry. The Office of Energy Assurance hopes to clarify and expand on this subject in its International Program Plan, which is currently in draft form. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). As mentioned earlier, HHS is the sector-specific agency for the public health and healthcare sector, and it shares that role with USDA for the food sector. Currently, there is no ISAC for the healthcare sector. Efforts to organize the healthcare sector have been ongoing. In July 2002, HHS officials and other government and industry participants were invited to the White House conference center to discuss how they wanted to organize the sector. A Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council (HSCC) was formed, and HHS requested that MITRE, its contractor, lend technical support to the new group as it continues to organize the sector and establish an ISAC. In addition, HHS officials stated that the department provided $500,000 for ISAC efforts in fiscal year 2003 and budgeted $1 million for fiscal year 2004. HHS officials stated that the department would likely be agreeable to continuing to provide funding for an ISAC. They also stated that an ISAC could be operational within the next year. In the meantime, HHS is sharing information with the industry through an e-Community group that MITRE has set up on a secure Web site. Agriculture and Food were only recently designated as critical infrastructure sectors and, as with the healthcare sector, efforts to organize the sectors are in the beginning stages. HHS has worked with the Food Marketing Institute-operated Food ISAC since it was established, but the department has focused more of its efforts on organizing the agriculture and food sectors. As we mentioned earlier, HHS helped initiate efforts to organize the sector by holding an introductory conference last summer for about 100 leading sector corporations and associations to make the business case for participating in CIP efforts. Recently, the department cohosted a meeting with DHS and USDA in which industry participants were asked how they wished to organize into an infrastructure sector, including addressing the existence and expansion of the current Food ISAC. As a result of this meeting, participants agreed to establish a council of about 10-15 private-sector food and agriculture organizations to represent the sector. A federal government council will be created to interact with the private sector and with state and local governments. The government council will initially include several federal government agencies and state and local entities. According to HHS officials, the timeframe for organizing the sector and setting up an expanded Food ISAC has not been determined, but officials anticipated this occurring by fall of 2004. veterinarians and animal hospitals on recognizing possible signs of bioterrorism activity. Although no longer a sector-specific agency for the transportation sector, DOT, through its Federal Transit Administration, has provided a grant to the Public Transportation ISAC to provide for memberships at no cost. Our discussions with the ISACs and the series of ISAC Council white papers confirmed that a number of challenges remain to the successful establishment and operation of ISACs and their partnership with DHS and other federal agencies. Highlighted below are some of the more significant challenges identified, along with any successful ISAC practices and related actions that have been taken or planned by DHS or others. Many of the ISACs report that they represent significant percentages of their industry sectors; at least one—the Electricity ISAC—reports participation approaching 100 percent. The ISAC Council estimates that the overall ISAC community possess an outreach and connectivity capability to reach approximately 65 percent of the private critical infrastructure. The Council also recognizes the challenge of increasing sector participation, particularly to reach smaller entities that need security support, but have insufficient resources to actively contribute and pay for such support. Officials in DHS’s IAIP acknowledge the importance of reaching out to critical infrastructure entities, and are considering alternatives to address this issue. appropriate tier of service; encourage membership through outreach programs sponsored by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the FSSCC in 24 cities; and to work with individual sector regulators to include in their audit checklists whether a firm is a member of the ISAC. The Financial Services ISAC believes that its goals are attainable and points to its industry coverage, which it says had already increased to 30 percent in March 2004—only three months after its new membership approach began in December 2003. Other issues identified that were related to increasing sector participation and reach included the following, Officials at two of the ISACs we contacted considered it important that the federal government voice its support for the ISACs as the principal tool for communicating threats. The ISAC Council has suggested that a General Business ISAC may need to be established to provide baseline security information to those general businesses that are not currently supported by an ISAC. Many of the industries that comprise our nation’s critical infrastructures are international in scope. Events that happen to a private infrastructure or public sector organization in another country can have a direct effect in the United States, just as events here could have effects in other countries. Therefore, an ISAC may need to increase its reach to include the reporting and trust of international companies and organizations. A key element in both establishing an ISAC and developing an effective public/private partnership for CIP is to build trusted relationships and processes. From the ISAC perspective, sharing information requires a trusted relationship between the ISAC and its membership, such that companies and organizations know their sensitive data is protected from others, including competitors and regulatory agencies. According to the ISAC Council, the ISACs believe that they provide a trusted information- sharing and analysis mechanism for private industry in that they manage, scrutinize, establish, and authenticate the identity and ensure the security of their membership, as well as ensuring the security of their own data and processes. Other steps taken by ISACs to safeguard private companies’ information, which may help to foster trusted relationships, included sharing information with other entities only when given permission to do so by the reporting entity and providing other protections, such as distributing sensitive information to subscribers through encrypted e-mail and a secure Web portal. Building trusted relationships between government agencies and the ISACs is also important to facilitating information sharing. In some cases, establishing such relationships may be difficult because sector-specific agencies may also have a regulatory role; for example, the Environmental Protection Agency has such a role for the Water sector and HHS’ Food and Drug Administration has it for portions of the Food and Agriculture sectors. Sharing information between the federal government and the private sector on incidents, threats, and vulnerabilities continues to be a challenge. As we reported last year, much of the reluctance by ISACs to share information has focused on concerns over potential government release of that information under the Freedom of Information Act, antitrust issues resulting from information sharing within an industry, and liability for the entity that discloses the information. However, our recent discussions with the ISACs—as well as the consensus of the ISAC Council—identified additional factors that may affect information sharing by both the ISACs and the government. The ISACs we contacted all described efforts to work with their sector- specific agencies, as well as with other federal agencies, ISACs, and organizations. For example, the Public Transit ISAC said that it provides a critical link between the transit industry, DOT, TSA, DHS, and other ISACs for critical infrastructures and that it collects, analyzes, and distributes cyber and physical threat information from a variety of sources, including law enforcement, government operations centers, the intelligence community, the U.S. military, academia, IT vendors, the International Computer Emergency Response Community, and others. Most ISACs reported that they believed they were providing appropriate information to the government but, while noting improvements, still had concerns with the information being provided to them by DHS and/or their sector- specific agencies. These concerns included the limited quantity of information and the need for more specific, timely, and actionable information. In particular, one ISAC noted that it receives information from DHS simultaneously with or even after news reports, and that sometimes the news reports provide more details. In its recent white papers, the ISAC Council also has identified a number of barriers to information sharing between the private sector and government. These included the sensitivity of the information (such as law enforcement information), legal limits on disclosure (such as Privacy Act limitations on disclosure of personally identifiable information), and contractual and business limits on how and when information is disclosed (e.g., the Financial Services ISAC does not allow any governmental or law enforcement access to its database). But the Council also emphasized that perhaps the greatest barriers to information sharing stem from practical and business considerations in that, although important, the benefits of sharing information are often difficult to discern, while the risks and costs of sharing are direct and foreseeable. Thus, to make information sharing real, it is essential to lower the practical risks of sharing information through both technical means and policies, and to develop internal systems that are capable of supporting operational requirements without interfering with core business. Consequently, the technical means used must be simple, inexpensive, secure, and easily built into business processes. According to the Council, the policy framework must reduce perceived risks and build trust among participants. Further, the Council identified three general areas that must be addressed in policy for the information- sharing network to assure network participants that there is good reason to participate and that their information will be dealt with appropriately. These areas concern policies related to what information is shared within ISACs, across ISACs, and to and from government; actions to be performed at each node in the information-sharing network, including the kinds of analysis to be performed; and the protection of shared information and analysis in terms of both limitations on disclosure and use and information security controls. The white papers also described the processes that are believed to be needed to ensure that critical infrastructure and/or security information is made available to the appropriate people with reasonable assurance that it cannot be used for malicious purposes or indiscriminately redistributed so as to become essentially public information. These processes and other information-sharing considerations and tasks identified by the Council included the following: The ISAC information-sharing process needs to recognize two types of information categories—classified and sensitive but unclassified. However, the majority of information sharing must focus on the unclassified “actionable element” that points the recipient to a problem and to remediation action. Each ISAC is responsible for initially validating the trust relationship with its member organizations and for periodically reassessing that trust relationship. The security structure must understand and continually be in dialogue with its vetted members and must manage this trusted relationship. Each individual who receives shared information must have a background check completed by and at a level of comprehensiveness specified by the sponsoring organization. Consequences and remediation must be developed and understood to address situations in which information is disclosed improperly—either intentionally or unintentionally. The government’s data and information requirements for the sectors and the sectors’ requirements for the government need to be defined. The government should establish a standing and formal trusted information-sharing and analysis process with the ISACs and sector coordinators as the trusted nodes for this dissemination. This body should be brought in at the beginning of any effort, and DHS products should be released to this group for primary and priority dissemination to their respective sectors. Building this trusted information-sharing and analysis process is also dependent on the protections the government provides for the sensitive data shared by ISACs and private companies. As discussed earlier, DHS recently issued the interim rule for submitting protected critical infrastructure information, which provides restrictions on the use of this information and exempts it from release under the Freedom of Information Act. However, it remains to be seen whether these protections will encourage greater private-sector trust and information sharing with the federal government. appropriately be their sector-specific agencies. Specifically, the Energy ISAC would like its sector-specific agency to be DHS and not the Department of Energy, which is also the regulatory agency for this sector. On the other hand, the Highway ISAC thought its sector-specific agency should be the Department of Transportation—the regulatory agency for its sector—and not DHS. The ISAC Council also identified the need for DHS to establish the goals of its directorates and the relationships of these directorates with the private sector. The Council also wants clarification of the roles of other federal agencies, state agencies, and other entities—such as the National Infrastructure Advisory Council. Ten of the ISACs we contacted, plus the Healthcare sector, emphasized the importance of government funding for purposes including creating the ISAC, supporting operations, increasing membership, developing metrics, and providing for additional capabilities. According to ISAC officials, some have already received federal funding: the Public Transit ISAC initially received a $1.2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration to begin operations, and the Water ISAC received a $2 million grant from EPA for fiscal year 2004 to cover annual operating costs and expand memberships to smaller utilities. In addition, the Financial Services ISAC received $2 million from the Department of the Treasury to help establish its next-generation ISAC and its new capabilities, including adding information about physical threats to the cyber threat information it disseminates. Despite such instances, funding continues to be an issue, even for those that have already received government funds. For example, the Healthcare Sector Coordinating Council, which is the sector coordinator for the healthcare industry, is currently looking to the federal government to help fund the creation of a Healthcare ISAC. Also, officials at the Public Transit ISAC noted that funding is an ongoing issue that is being pursued with DHS. Officials at the Financial Services ISAC, who notes that the ISAC’s goal is to become totally self-funded through membership fees by 2005, are also seeking additional government funding for other projects. funding for an ISAC analyst to work at DHS to support analysis of sector- specific information or intelligence requirements. According to the Financial Services ISAC, DHS has agreed to fund tabletop exercises for some ISACs. For example, according to DHS officials, exercises are occurring this week involving the Banking and Finance sector and exercises for other sectors are currently being explored. In addition, energy sector-related exercises were held earlier in the year. DHS officials also stated that funding considerations for the critical infrastructure sectors and the ISACs would be based on their needs. In our discussions with ISAC officials, several, such as officials from the Surface Transportation and the Telecommunications ISACs, highlighted their analysis capabilities and, in particular, their analysts’ sector-specific knowledge and expertise and ability to work with DHS and other federal agencies. The ISAC Council also emphasized that analysis by sector- specific, subject matter experts is a critical capability for the ISACs, intended to help identify and categorize threats and vulnerabilities and then identify emerging trends before they can affect critical infrastructures. Sector-specific analysis can add critical value to the information being disseminated, with products such as 24/7 immediate, sector-specific, physical, cyber, all threat and incident report warning; sector-specific information and intelligence requirements; forecasts of and mitigation strategies for emerging threats; and cross-sector interdependencies, vulnerabilities, and threats. The Council also emphasized that although government analytical efforts are critical, private-sector analytical efforts should not be overlooked and must be integrated into the federal processes for a more complete understanding. The private sector understands its processes, assets, and operations best and can be relied upon to provide the required private- sector subject matter expertise. In a few cases, the integration of private-sector analytical capabilities with DHS does occur. For example, the Telecommunications ISAC, as part of DHS’s National Communication System, has watch standers that are part of the DHS operations center and share information, when the information owner allows it and when it is appropriate and relevant, with the other analysts. In addition, a Surface Transportation ISAC analyst also participates in the DHS operations center on a part-time basis to offer expertise and connection to experts in the field in order to clarify the impact of possible threats. The ISAC Council highlighted the need for ISAC participation in the national-level homeland security exercises that are conducted by the federal government, such as DHS’s May 2003 national terrorism exercise (TOPOFF 2), which was designed to identify vulnerabilities in the nation’s domestic incident management capability. However, according to the Council, there has been little or no integration of active private industry and infrastructure into such exercises. For example, private industry participation in TOPOFF 2 was simulated. The Council believes that with such participation, both national and private-sector goals could be established during the creation of the exercise and then addressed during the exercise. The Council did identify examples where the private sector is being included in exercises, such as efforts by the Electronics Crime Unit of the U.S. Secret Service to reach out to the private sector and support tabletop exercises to address the security of private infrastructures. Further, according to a DHS official, the department has agreed to fund tabletop exercises for members of several ISACs, including Financial Services, Chemical, and Electricity, as well as a cross-sector tabletop exercise. Additional challenges identified by our work and/or emphasized by the ISAC Council included the following. Obtaining Security Clearances to Share Classified Information. As we reported last year, several ISACs identified obtaining security clearances as a challenge to government information sharing with the ISACs. Seven of the 15 ISACs with which we discussed this issue indicated either that some of their security clearances were pending or that additional clearances would be needed. Identifying Sector Interdependencies. Federal CIP policy has emphasized the need to identify and understand interdependencies between infrastructure sectors. The ISAC Council also highlighted the importance of identifying interdependencies and emphasized that they require partnerships between the sectors and the government and could only be modeled, simulated, or “practiced” once the individual sectors’ dynamics are understood sufficiently. The current short-term focus for the ISACs is to review the work done by the government and the sectors regarding interdependencies. Similarly, a DHS official acknowledged the importance of identifying interdependencies, but that it is a longer-term issue. Establishing Communications Networks. Another issue raised through the ISAC Council’s white papers was the need for a government-provided communications network for secure information sharing and analysis. Specifically, the Council suggested that although functionality would be needed to satisfy the ISAC s’ requirements, DHS’s Critical Infrastructure Warning Information Network (CWIN) could be used as an interim, first- phase communications capability. According to the Council, some of the ISACs are conducting routine communications checks at the analytical level in anticipation of expanded use of CWIN. In discussing this issue with a DHS official, he said that ISAC access to a secure communications network would be provided as part of the planned Homeland Security Data Network (HSDN). DHS recently announced a contract to initiate the implementation of HSDN, which is be a private, certified, and accredited network that provides DHS officials with a modern IT infrastructure for securely communicating classified information. According to DHS, this network will be designed to be scalable in order to respond to increasing demands for the secure transmission of classified information among government, industry, and academia to help defend against terrorist attacks. At the time of our study, the relationship and interaction among DHS, the ISACs, sector coordinators, and other sector-specific agencies was still evolving, and DHS had not yet developed any documented policies or procedures. As we discussed earlier, HSPD-7 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish uniform policies for integrating federal infrastructure protection and risk management activities within and across sectors. According to a DHS official, the department is developing a plan (referred to as a “roadmap”) that documents the current information- sharing relationships among DHS, the ISACs, and other agencies; goals for improving that information-sharing relationship; and methods for measuring the progress in the improvement. According to this official, the plan is to define the roles and responsibilities of DHS, the ISACs, and other entities, including a potential overlap of ISAC-related responsibilities between IAIP and the Transportation Security Administration. Further, the official indicated that, in developing the plan, DHS would consider issues raised by the ISAC Council. public/private partnership. Federal agencies have provided assistance to help establish the ISACs, and more may be needed. However, at this time, the ISACs and other stakeholders, including sector-specific agencies and sector coordinators, would benefit from an overall strategy, as well as specific guidance, that clearly described their roles, responsibilities, relationships, and expectations. DHS is beginning to develop a strategy, and in doing so, it will be important to consider input from all stakeholders to help ensure that a comprehensive and trusted information- sharing process is established.

Effective information-sharing partnerships between industry sectors and government can contribute to CIP efforts. Federal policy has encouraged the voluntary creation of information sharing and analysis centers (ISAC) to facilitate infrastructure sector participation in CIP information sharing efforts. GAO was asked to identify actions that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) could take to improve the effectiveness of CIP information-sharing efforts. Federal awareness of the importance of securing the nation's critical infrastructures--and the federal government's strategy to encourage cooperative efforts among state and local governments and the private sector to protect these infrastructures--have been evolving since the mid-1990s. Federal policy continues to emphasize the importance of the ISACs and their information-sharing functions. In addition, federal policy established specific responsibilities for DHS and other federal agencies involved with the CIP sectors. The ISACs have identified challenges requiring further federal action, including building trusted relationships; developing processes to facilitate information sharing; overcoming barriers to information sharing; clarifying the roles and responsibilities of the various government and private-sector entities that are involved in protecting critical infrastructures; and funding ISAC operations and activities. A lthough DHS has taken a number of actions to implement the public/private partnership called for by federal CIP policy, it has not yet developed a plan that describes how it will carry out its information-sharing responsibilities and relationships. Such a plan could encourage improved information sharing among the ISACs, other CIP entities, and the department by clarifying the roles and responsibilities of all the entities involved and clearly articulating actions to address the challenges that remain. DHS officials indicated that they intend to develop an information-sharing plan, but no specific time frame for completing the plan has been established. The department also lacks policies and procedures to ensure effective coordination and sharing of ISAC-provided information among the appropriate components within the department. Developing policies and procedures would help ensure that information is effectively and efficiently shared among its components and with other government and private-sector CIP entities.", "prediction": "DHS has established functions within the department to support the ISACs and other CIP efforts. DHS has established functions within the department to support the ISACs and other CIP efforts. Building trusted relationships between government agencies and the ISACs is also important to facilitating information sharing."}
{"index": 1, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Scientific research indicates that in recent years, the frequency and geographic distribution of harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasing nationally and globally. HABs can be detrimental to human health, animals, aquatic ecosystems, and local economies. In 2014, a major HAB in Lake Erie caused the city of Toledo, Ohio, to issue a \"do not drink\" order for tap water that left more than 500,000 people without drinking water for two days and had an estimated impact of $65 million in lost benefits. In the summer of 2016, a massive HAB in Lake Okeechobee—Florida's largest freshwater lake—resulted in beach closures, losses to the tourism industry, and negative impacts on marine life. According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), between January 1 and August 12, 2016, states reported at least 266 notices for freshwater HABs, including cautions, warnings, public health advisories, and public health warnings. Congress, many federal agencies, states, localities, and other partners have taken and continue to take steps to address the rising trend in HABs and their impacts. However, there are many gaps in current scientific understanding of HABs among the research and management communities and considerable debate as to how best to address the issue from a regulatory standpoint. This report explores these issues as they pertain to HABs in freshwater systems. Specifically, it addresses the conditions and activities that contribute to the occurrence of freshwater HABs; steps that Congress, federal agencies—particularly EPA—and their partners are taking to address and mitigate their occurrence; and the current knowledge gaps on this issue. This report is focused on freshwater HABs, not marine or coastal HABs or issues associated with HABs in drinking water supplies. Algal communities are naturally occurring components of healthy aquatic ecosystems, such as lakes, rivers, and estuaries. However, under certain environmental conditions, such as increased temperatures and nutrient concentrations (e.g., nitrogen and phosphorus), colonies of algae can grow excessively, or \"bloom,\" and produce toxins that pose a threat to human and aquatic ecosystem health and potentially cause economic damage. These HABs sometimes produce discolorations in the water that can appear as scums, paint-like slicks, clotted mats, or foam that may vary in color (i.e., light to dark green, yellow, red, or brown). Even when visible signs of a bloom are absent, however, algal toxins may still cause harmful effects. Figure 1 shows an aerial view of a HAB that produced visible green scums in Lake Okeechobee, Florida, in July 2016. While many types of algae can cause HABs in bodies of freshwater, cyanobacteria (sometimes referred to as blue-green algae) typically cause the most frequent and severe blooms. Cyanobacterial HABs pose a threat to human and aquatic ecosystem health and can kill pets, livestock, and wildlife. Some species of cyanobacteria produce toxins, called cyanotoxins, which can cause hepatic (liver-related), neurologic, respiratory, dermatologic, and other symptoms. These may be acute or chronic, mild or severe, and in some cases may be fatal. Humans may be exposed to cyanotoxins by consuming tainted drinking water, fish, or shellfish; swimming or recreating in waters with certain concentrations of cyanotoxins present; or inhaling aerosolized toxins. The cyanotoxins associated with these HABs can contaminate fish, interfere with a variety of recreational activities, and cause other economic and environmental damages. There are many types of cyanotoxins, which may have multiple variants with a wide range of toxicities. The most commonly occurring and most studied cyanotoxin is microcystin. Although cyanobacterial HABs are considered to be the most prevalent and toxic types of HABs, blooms of \"golden algae\" ( Prymnesium parvum ) are an emerging problem and likely the most problematic of non-cyanobacterial freshwater HAB taxa (i.e., group of related organisms classified as a unit). Golden algal HABs have caused large fish kills worldwide, including millions of fish in Texas. Most of the major fish kills have occurred since 2000. Golden algae thrive in brackish water, such as the rivers and reservoirs found in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, and Wyoming. The toxins produced by golden algae target gill-breathing organisms, such as fish, clams, and mussels. According to information from two states that experience golden algal blooms, there is currently no evidence that golden algal toxins pose a direct threat to humans, other mammals, or birds. Effects of cyanobacterial HABs and golden algae HABs are detailed in Table 1 . In addition to the effects of algal toxins on human and animal health, HABs can also contribute to deteriorating water quality and ecosystem health. An overabundance of cyanobacteria or other algae can block out sunlight and clog fish gills. In addition, as the algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen, leaving waterways in a hypoxic (or low oxygen) state, sometimes forming \"dead zones\"—areas where life cannot survive due to lack of oxygen. Low oxygen areas can suffocate and kill fish and bottom-dwelling organisms such as crabs and clams. According to EPA, over 166 dead zones have been documented nationwide, including in waterbodies such as the Chesapeake Bay and the Gulf of Mexico. Significant economic losses have occurred as a result of hypoxia. Many factors may influence the occurrence and prevalence of HABs in freshwater, including nutrient concentrations, water temperature, availability of light, pH, and water circulation. Nutrient enrichment is widely recognized as one of the key causes of HAB formation. Nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are essential to plant growth and natural parts of aquatic ecosystems. However, when high levels of nutrients enter a body of water, they stimulate plant and algal growth, which can lead to depletion of dissolved oxygen (as explained above), reduced transparency (i.e., turbidity), changes to the biological community (e.g., loss of sportfish, such as bass), and degradation of the aesthetic appeal of the water (i.e., from odor and scums). This process is called eutrophication. While some sources of nutrients in water bodies are natural, many anthropogenic activities contribute nutrients to waterbodies from a number of point and nonpoint sources. Point sources include municipal and industrial wastewater discharges and concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). Nonpoint sources include urban stormwater runoff, failing septic systems, atmospheric deposition of nitrogen from fossil fuel emissions, runoff from fertilized cropland, and manure runoff from cropland, pastures, and animal feeding operations. See Table 2 for more information on these sources. Studies also indicate that increased temperatures and changes in frequency and intensity of rainfall associated with climate change may also favor HAB formation. HABs generally proliferate in warmer waters. In addition, some studies have found that swings between flooding and drought may enhance HAB formation. For example, if intense rainfall is followed by a drought, the nutrients washed into receiving water bodies may remain in them longer, increasing the potential for HABs. Scientists largely agree that the frequency and distribution of HABs, the economic losses from them, the types of resources affected, and the number of toxins and toxic species have all increased in recent years. Some scientists note that factors such as better detection methods and increased reporting have contributed to the upward trend. HABs, including cyanobacterial HABs, have been recorded in the waters of all 50 states, with some HABs crossing state lines. Figure 2 shows the generalized distribution of selected freshwater HAB events (cyanobacterial HABs and golden algal HABs) that took place between 2006 and 2015 across the United States. The findings of EPA's most recent national assessment of lakes are consistent with other reports of the rising trend in HABs. In EPA's 2012 National Lake Assessment, EPA concluded that there was little change from its 2007 survey of lakes, with two exceptions—trends in algal toxin and nutrient measures. In 2012, EPA and its partners detected microcystin in 39% of lakes, a 9.5% increase from 2007. EPA noted, however, that for both studies, the concentrations of microcystin remained low and rarely exceeded the levels of concern established by the World Health Organization for recreational uses (see \" Regulatory Efforts and Guidelines \"). EPA also found an 8.3% increase in the percentage of lakes in the \"most disturbed condition\" category when analyzing the density of cyanobacterial cells (i.e., an indicator of risk for exposure to algal toxins because the cells may produce toxins). Finally, EPA found an overall increase in the median concentration of phosphorus across all lakes and a \"dramatic\" decline (18.2%) in the percentage of lakes with low nutrients and high oxygen levels. These findings are important because in many lakes, phosphorus is considered the limiting nutrient, meaning that the available quantity of this nutrient controls the pace of algal production. It also means that even small increases in phosphorus can lead to very rapid increases in algal growth. More broadly, the study found that nutrient pollution is a widespread problem across the country. Approximately 35% of lakes have excessive levels of total nitrogen, and 40% of lakes have excessive levels of total phosphorus. Congress has recognized the increasing frequency of HABs and has passed legislation in an effort to address public health, economic, and environmental consequences of HABs. In 1998, Congress passed the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (HABHRCA), which established an Interagency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia. It required the task force to prepare reports assessing HABs and hypoxia with a focus on coastal waters and authorized funding for HAB and hypoxia-related research, education, and monitoring activities. The Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) chaired the task force. In 2004, Congress reauthorized HABHRCA and expanded it to include assessments of HABs in freshwater. In 2014, Congress again reauthorized HABHRCA and established a national HAB/Hypoxia Program to be maintained by NOAA through the task force. It identified NOAA and EPA as the lead federal agencies for marine and freshwater aspects of the program, respectively, and required additional reports and a comprehensive research plan and action strategy. In 2015, in response to public safety concerns arising from the Toledo, Ohio, HAB event, Congress passed legislation addressing algal toxins in drinking water. The Drinking Water Protection Act amended the Safe Drinking Water Act to require EPA to develop a strategic plan to assess and manage the risks associated with algal toxins in public drinking water supplies. The following year, Congress included a provision in the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation (WIIN) Act that required EPA to designate a Harmful Algal Bloom Coordinator to coordinate projects and activities under the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative involving HABs in the Great Lakes. Table 3 provides a list and description of the HAB-specific legislation enacted since 1998. In addition to HAB-specific legislation, the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes EPA to address water quality concerns associated with HABs. The act establishes a system, under Section 303, for states to adopt ambient water quality standards consisting of the designated use or uses of a water body (e.g., recreational, public water supply, or aquatic life) and the water quality criteria that are necessary to protect the use or uses. States then use their water quality standards to determine which waters must be cleaned up, how much effluent may be discharged, and what is needed for protection. Section 304(a) requires the EPA Administrator to publish and, from time to time, revise water quality criteria that accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge on the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on human health and the environment that might be expected from the presence of pollutants. These criteria constitute guidance that states use in adopting their water quality standards. As recognized by Section 510 of the CWA, states may develop water quality standards that are more stringent than required by EPA regulations. EPA's water quality standards regulations require that in developing water quality standards, states must adopt water quality criteria that protect the designated use. States are to establish numerical criteria —based on (1) EPA's recommended criteria, (2) EPA's criteria modified to reflect site-specific conditions, or (3) other scientifically defensible methods—and establish narrative criteria or criteria based on biomonitoring methods where numerical criteria cannot be established or to supplement numerical criteria. Section 303(d) of the CWA requires states to identify waters that are impaired by pollution, even after application of pollution controls. For those waters, states must establish a Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) of pollutants to ensure that water quality standards can be attained. A TMDL is a quantitative assessment of pollution sources and pollutant reductions needed to restore and protect U.S. waters; it is also a planning process for attaining water quality standards. TMDLs may address all pollution sources, including point sources, such as municipal sewage treatment or industrial plant discharges, and nonpoint sources such as urban runoff and agricultural runoff. Also, Section 118 of the CWA provides that the United States should seek to attain the goals embodied in the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, as amended by the Water Quality Agreement of 1987 and any other agreements and amendments. It tasks EPA to take the lead in the effort to meet the agreement's goals, working with other federal agencies, states, and localities. As seen in the text box, the most recent amendment includes a HAB-related goal. Many federal agencies are involved in carrying out various HAB-related activities, including conducting HAB research, monitoring algal toxins and water quality, forecasting HABs, supporting projects to improve water quality, and community outreach efforts. Some in Congress, however, have expressed concern about the activities and expenditures of various agencies and potential redundancies. In the Drinking Water Protection Act ( P.L. 114-45 ), enacted August 7, 2015, Congress directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to inventory funds expended by federal agencies to examine toxin-producing cyanobacteria and algae or address public health concerns related to harmful algal blooms. GAO was to recommend ways to improve interagency coordination and reduce duplication of efforts. According to the 2016 GAO report that responded to the mandate, 17 agencies conducted research, monitoring, response, or other HAB-related activities between FY2013 and FY2015. The GAO report provides detailed information on federal agencies' key HAB-related activities, expenditures, and specific statutory authorities, and, thus, this report will not discuss these in detail. Rather, this section identifies the federal agencies involved in a key interagency effort and highlights actions EPA specifically is taking in its role as the leader of freshwater HAB issues. As previously mentioned, HABHRCA established an interagency task force that is charged with promoting a national strategy to help communities understand, predict, control, and mitigate freshwater and marine HAB and hypoxia events; enhancing, coordinating, and assessing the activities of existing HABs and hypoxia programs; and providing for development of a comprehensive research plan and action strategy. Table 4 provides a list of the federal agencies and organizations specifically required in HABHRCA to participate on the task force. The reauthorization of HABHRCA in 2014 reconstituted the task force as the Interagency Working Group on the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act (IWG-HABHRCA), responsible for maintaining a national HAB/hypoxia program. NOAA and EPA share primary responsibility under HABHRCA for administering the national HAB and hypoxia program, with NOAA leading marine aspects of the program and EPA in charge of freshwater aspects. In addition to agencies listed in the table, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is an active member in the IWG-HABHRCA. In its role under HABHRCA and the CWA, EPA's efforts to address HABs include coordinating the efforts of multiple entities, developing regulations and guidelines to protect water quality (see \" Regulatory Efforts and Guidelines \" section), conducting research, providing financial assistance through grants and other agreements, and educating the public. In its coordination role, EPA leads, chairs, or cochairs several working groups or task forces, including the IWG-HABHRCA, the Inland HAB Discussion Group, the Great Lakes Interagency Task Force, and the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force (Hypoxia Task Force). See Table 5 for a description of these efforts. EPA has also conducted internal research on HABs and their toxins focused on water quality (including how different factors such as nutrients, light, temperature, etc., affect HAB occurrence and toxicity), human and ecological health effects, monitoring and analytical methods research, and drinking water treatment research. The agency also provides research grants, such as those provided through the Science to Achieve Results (STAR) program, focused on topic areas including the prediction, prevention, control, and mitigation of freshwater HABs and the fate and effects from less-common emerging HABs. EPA also provides financial assistance to states, tribes, and others to address water pollution, including nonpoint source pollution. Examples of such assistance include nonpoint source implementation grants under CWA Section 319, capitalization grants under the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, and grants under CWA Section 106, which are provided to states, interstate agencies, and tribes to administer programs that prevent, reduce, and eliminate water pollution. EPA and states have also taken steps to address HABs and nutrient loads that contribute to their proliferation through regulatory efforts and guidelines. This section focuses on regulatory efforts and guidelines related to EPA's authorities under the CWA and specifically excludes efforts under the Safe Drinking Water Act. EPA, the World Health Organization (WHO), and many states have developed guidelines for cyanotoxins in recreational waters. These guidelines are summarized in Table 6 and discussed below. In December 2016, EPA issued draft recreational water quality criteria for microcystins and cylindrospermopsin for public comment. According to EPA, these criteria reflect the concentrations of two cyanotoxins that would be protective of human health in recreational waters used for swimming or other activities: 4 µg/L for microcystin and 8 µg/L for cylindrospermopsin. EPA suggests that states may consider using the proposed values when determining whether to post swimming advisories in recreational waters and may consider using the same values when adopting new or revised water quality standards. Many entities—including states, representatives of publicly owned treatment works, agricultural organizations, and environmental groups—provided comments on the draft criteria: Some commenters, including states, were supportive of the criteria for purposes of informing swimming advisory decisions but did not support the use of the criteria for developing water quality standards, noting, among other concerns, that cyanotoxins are not a pollutant discharged into waterways but rather result from other pollutants (nutrients) entering waterways and other factors. Environmental groups generally supported EPA's criteria for use in both swimming advisories and development of water quality standards. Commenters' opinions varied regarding the proposed concentrations of microcystin and cylindrospermopsin in the draft criteria. Some states felt the levels were appropriate, environmental groups felt they should be more stringent, and other states suggested they are overly protective, particularly when compared to the WHO guideline for microcystin. Many commenters—particularly states, publicly owned treatment works, and agricultural groups—expressed a number of implementation concerns. One key concern raised was that these criteria, if used for water quality standards, would improperly regulate response organisms rather than a discharged pollutant. Some argued that algal toxins are not a pollutant that CWA permittees discharge. Rather, the discharge of other pollutants, such as excess nutrients, may lead to HAB formation. In its draft criteria document, EPA explained that it does not anticipate states using the criteria alone for permitting purposes, recognizing that cyanobacteria and their toxins are not typically present in permitted discharges. EPA goes on to say the following: Permits are more likely to be written to address point source discharges of the causal pollutants, such as nutrients, on a waterbody-specific or watershed basis, where the permit writer has determined there is a reasonable potential for the causal pollutants in the discharge to cause or contribute to an exceedance of the cyanotoxin standards. In this regard, some commenters expressed concern that it is not known precisely what level of nutrients will result in a bloom, nor is it understood what factors will trigger the release of toxins. Several commenters suggested that EPA explore these issues further before moving forward with water quality criteria for purposes other than guiding advisory levels for swimming. Many commenters also expressed implementation concerns regarding monitoring and sampling. According to the Association of Clean Water Administrators many states do not currently have mechanisms in place to adequately sample for the levels of the toxins specified by EPA or lack adequate lab capacity to process increased samples. Some states, publicly owned treatment works, and agricultural groups also commented that the variability of HABs within a body of water and over even short spans of time can make sampling and analysis complicated, particularly when using the data to determine if a water body is impaired. The commenters urged EPA to address these issues in detail before moving forward with the criteria. In 2003, WHO proposed guideline values for protection from adverse health outcomes associated with cyanobacteria blooms in fresh water used for recreational purposes. The guidelines are defined at three levels: low, moderate, and high probability of adverse health effects. WHO concluded that a single guideline value was not appropriate because \"it is necessary to differentiate between the chiefly irritative symptoms caused by unknown cyanobacterial substances and the potentially more severe hazard of exposure to high concentrations of known cyanotoxins, particularly microcystins.\" Table 6 shows the WHO guideline levels for microcystin. According to EPA documents, approximately 30 states have implemented cyanobacterial HAB guidelines for recreational waterways as of November 2015. Some of these states use qualitative guidelines only (i.e., visual inspection for blooms rather than quantitative detection methods) or quantitative guidelines for cyanobacterial cell density rather than guidelines for the specific cyanotoxins. Of the 30 states that have implemented cyanobacterial HAB guidelines, 21 have established numeric guidelines for microcystin or cylindrospermopsin. The levels and associated actions vary considerably among states (see Table 6 ). California has adopted the strictest concentrations for both cyanotoxins (0.8 µg/L for microcystin and 4 µg/L for cylindrospermopsin). Several states have adopted the WHO value of 20 µg/L for microcystin. Only seven states have adopted quantitative guidelines for cylindrospermopsin. Some states have also added waters affected by algal blooms and algal toxins to their impaired water lists (i.e., Section 303(d) lists) for algal blooms and algal toxins. According to data from EPA's Assessment and Total Maximum Daily Load Tracking and Implementation System, 24 states have listed waters impaired for algal blooms, and two states—California and New Hampshire—have listed waters impaired for algal toxins (see Table 7 ). California has listed only one of its waters as impaired for algal toxins and has not yet developed a TMDL. New Hampshire has listed 66 of its waters as impaired for algal toxins and has developed one TMDL that covers two waters. The New Hampshire TMDL establishes a total phosphorus loading target that, if met, is expected to achieve state water quality criteria and thresholds for dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a (an indicator of algae), and cyanobacteria. Scientists and policymakers widely recognize the need to reduce nutrient inputs to aquatic systems to limit eutrophication and proliferation of HABs. According to EPA, nitrogen and phosphorus pollution is one of the most serious and pervasive water quality problems in the United States. While EPA and states have worked to address nutrient pollution for over a decade, many observers believe more progress is needed to reduce the threat to water quality and public health. EPA has acknowledged that without greater progress, \"the successes to date will likely be outpaced by the rapidly increasing population and the resulting increase in the rate and impact of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution.\" According to EPA, 45 states identified nutrient-related pollution as a priority to be addressed by TMDLs and/or alternative restoration plans in setting long-term priorities for their CWA Section 303(d) programs. To date, more than 8,600 nutrient-related TMDLs have been established, primarily by states, to guide nutrient reduction efforts in more than 5,800 waterbodies. In 2016, EPA issued a memorandum with a renewed call to states and stakeholders to intensify their efforts, in collaboration with EPA, to reduce nutrient pollution. The memorandum emphasized EPA's support for state planning or implementation of watershed-based, multistakeholder projects to reduce the impacts to public health from nitrogen and phosphorus pollution contributing to HABs. EPA listed and described key elements of its plans for working with partners and stakeholders over the next several years, including prioritizing watersheds and setting load reduction goals, developing numeric nutrient criteria, reducing point sources of nutrient pollution, reducing nutrient loads from nonpoint sources, and providing financial and technical assistance. For almost two decades, EPA has expressed support for developing numeric criteria for nutrients. In a memorandum issued in 2011, EPA stated that \"it has long been EPA's position that numeric criteria targeted at different categories of water bodies and informed by scientific understanding of the relationship between nutrient loadings and water quality impairment are ultimately necessary for effective state programs.\" To this end, EPA has provided 30 states with technical assistance for numeric nutrient criteria development through its Nutrient Scientific Technical Exchange Partnership and Support Program. To date, 23 states have adopted numeric criteria into their water quality standards for nitrogen and/or phosphorus for at least one of their water bodies. In 2013, EPA outlined barriers to numeric nutrient criteria implementation and actions to help states address them. The barriers included, among other things, an inability to reduce nonpoint source loads of nitrogen and phosphorus and problems implementing water-quality-based limits. EPA has also emphasized the need to focus on reducing nutrients from all sources—both point and nonpoint sources. Under the CWA, EPA has authority to regulate discharges from point sources. However, the CWA does not authorize EPA to regulate nonpoint sources. EPA can influence activities of nonpoint sources only through use of grants and funding—such as CWA Section 319, which addresses nonpoint source pollution through state-run nonpoint pollution management programs—and related technical assistance. Through such programs, states may, for example, ask farmers or ranchers to use alternative methods in their operations to prevent fertilizers from reaching streams and may provide funds to help them install on-farm pollution management systems or practices. In its document addressing barriers to numeric nutrient criteria, EPA proposed actions to address them, including continuing to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Agriculture to leverage resources for conservation practices and to better quantify the environmental results of best management practices and other efforts, continuing to implement the Section 319 grant program, and addressing the challenges of manure management by working with large animal growers and poultry integrators to develop sustainability agreements and practices that reduce nutrient pollution. Some observers argue that the voluntary nature of controlling nonpoint sources is a key challenge in developing and implementing TMDLs, a primary tool that states are employing to address nutrient pollution. Farming and forestry groups have long been concerned about how their activities might be addressed in TMDLs and whether they might be subject to CWA regulation of some sort, even though the act does not provide EPA with regulatory authority over nonpoint sources. Municipalities and industries contend that regulating only point sources imposes disproportionate requirements on their operations, especially in waters that are impaired both by point and nonpoint sources. Recognizing that a critical role for EPA in addressing nutrient pollution is supporting watershed-based efforts at the state and local level, in its 2016 memorandum, the agency stated that the Office of Water would continue to provide financial assistance to states through CWA Section 106 and Section 319 grant programs and the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) Program, as well as Section 604(b) planning grants, Wetland Program Development grants, and grants targeted toward specific geographic locations, such as the Chesapeake Bay, Great Lakes, and other water bodies. The President's FY2019 budget request for EPA proposes that funding for these programs, with the exception of the CWSRF, be eliminated or significantly reduced (see Table 8 ). The proportion of funds provided to nonpoint source pollution projects through the CWSRF program is relatively minor compared to the amount provided to publicly owned treatment works for infrastructure projects. As reported by EPA, 96% of the cumulative assistance provided through the CWSRF as of 2016 has been provided to publicly owned treatment works; only 4% was provided to nonpoint source pollution projects and National Estuary Program projects. It is unclear how, considering EPA's long-standing emphasis on using these programs to address nonpoint source pollution, the FY2019 budget would support the goals of the agency in its efforts to reduce nutrient pollution, and ultimately reduce the occurrence and frequency of HABs. Table 8 presents a comparison of the President's FY2019 budget request with the FY2016-FY2018 enacted appropriations for selected grants and programs referenced above that include funding support for addressing nonpoint source pollution. These grants and programs are funded within the EPA State and Tribal Assistance Grants and the Environmental Programs and Management appropriations accounts. In addition to the challenges of reducing nutrient pollution contributing to HABs, scientists widely recognize key research gaps that hinder the ability to prevent, predict, minimize, and suppress HABs. In reauthorizing HABHRCA in 2014, as discussed above, Congress directed NOAA—through the IWG-HABHRCA—to prepare a comprehensive research plan and action strategy to address marine and freshwater harmful algal blooms and hypoxia. The February 2016 task force report includes a discussion of the key challenges in HAB and hypoxia management and discusses the many gaps in the research and management communities' knowledge of HAB and hypoxia events. Federal agencies—including USGS, EPA, and NOAA —and research efforts sponsored by these agencies cite similar gaps and areas needing continuing research. The following text box summarizes some of these key research areas. Congressional interest in HABs has largely focused on funding further research and coordinating the efforts of federal agencies and their partners to study and address HABs. In the 115 th Congress, the Senate passed S. 1057 , which would, among other things, reauthorize HABHRCA for FY2019-FY2023, add the Army Corps of Engineers to the interagency task force, and allow the administrators of NOAA (marine) or EPA (freshwater) to declare a HAB or hypoxia event as an event of \"national significance.\" Such a determination would prompt authority for the administrators to provide funding to the affected state or local government. A related bill, H.R. 4417 , has been introduced in the House. The Senate also passed S. 129 , which would reauthorize the National Sea Grant Program and make funds available for HAB research through that program. The bill would authorize grants for university research on several targeted topics, including \"the biology, prevention, and forecasting of harmful algal blooms.\" A related bill, H.R. 4306 , has been introduced in the House. The Great Lakes and Fresh Water Algal Bloom Information Act ( H.R. 1893 ) in the 115 th Congress would require NOAA to create an electronic database of research and information on the causes of, and corrective actions being taken with regard to, algal blooms in the Great Lakes, their tributaries, and other surface fresh waters and for other purposes. H.R. 3661 would establish a program to award prizes for the development of innovative, environmentally safe solutions for reducing, mitigating, and controlling harmful algal blooms and for other purposes. Three bills have been introduced that would seek to address issues specific to Lake Okeechobee and the Florida Everglades: H.R. 2137 seeks to address concerns arising from the HAB outbreak that occurred in Lake Okeechobee, FL, during the summer of 2016. Record rainfalls and an impending hurricane season prompted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to release water from the lake into rivers and estuaries in an attempt to keep the lake from overflowing. The releases occurred at a time when a lake-wide HAB was forming, allowing nutrients and algae to move downstream, eventually reaching area beaches and requiring beach closures and cleanups that had substantial impacts on the local and state economy. Florida's governor requested a federal state of emergency declaration, which the Federal Emergency Management Agency denied because it determined that supplemental federal assistance under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act was not considered appropriate for the event. H.R. 2137 would direct the President to treat a harmful algal bloom \"caused by certain activities of the Federal Government\" as an emergency for the purposes of the Stafford Act. H.R. 3665 would require the IWG-HABHRCA to prepare an assessment and a plan for reducing, mitigating, and controlling HABs and hypoxia in the Greater Everglades region, similar to what the working group has completed at a national level and for the Great Lakes region. H.R. 6645 would—similar to S. 1057 and H.R. 4417 —reauthorize HABHRCA but would also, like H.R. 3665 , require an assessment and action plan for the Everglades region. Recent HAB events highlight the public health, economic, and environmental consequences that communities in the United States may continue to experience, perhaps on a more frequent basis. EPA, NOAA, and other federal agencies are working together to conduct important HAB-related research in an effort to close the gaps in the scientific and management community's understanding of how best to prevent, predict, minimize, and suppress HABs. EPA, states, and their partners are working to identify and restore waterbodies that are affected by HABs and the excess nutrients that contribute to their formation. Congress has passed legislation to help drive and fund research efforts and improve collaboration among the many federal agencies involved in HAB-related activities. Moving forward, Congress may be interested in oversight of the Administration's efforts to implement HABHRCA and other HAB-related authorities. While Congress, federal agencies, and states are taking steps to address HABs, many observers assert that further action is needed to make progress that outpaces the growing consequences of nutrient pollution. Most observers agree that further research is needed to understand the most appropriate way to predict, minimize, and suppress HAB outbreaks, including whether and how to regulate algal toxins. These advocates assert that Congress should ensure that adequate funding is available for such research. To control HABs, some advocate for regulation of nonpoint source pollution, arguing that point sources are disproportionately regulated and that nonpoint sources are the larger contributors to nutrient pollution. Instead of regulation, some argue that EPA and other federal agencies should continue to focus on collaborative, voluntary watershed-level efforts to address nonpoint source pollution that contributes to HAB formation and that Congress should ensure that financial assistance for these efforts continues. Controlling nonpoint sources of excess nutrients that contribute to HAB formation is challenging. They are diffuse and pervasive and often attributable to many sources and activities rather than a single cause. Yet, scientists generally agree that the current trends in overenriched waters and HAB events cannot be corrected without addressing nonpoint source nutrient pollution in a significant way and that controlling point sources alone is not enough. Given the consequences of HABs and the difficulty in controlling nonpoint sources of the nutrients that contribute to their formation, challenges and issues associated with HABs are likely to remain of interest to Congress.", "reference": "Scientific research indicates that in recent years, the frequency and geographic distribution of harmful algal blooms (HABs) have been increasing nationally and globally. Because the impacts of HABs can be severe and widespread—often with interstate implications—these issues have been a perennial interest for Congress. While algal communities are natural components of healthy aquatic ecosystems, under certain conditions (e.g., increased temperatures and nutrient concentrations), algae may grow excessively, or \"bloom,\" and produce toxins that can harm human health, animals, aquatic ecosystems, and the economy. In 2014, a cyanobacterial HAB in Lake Erie affected the drinking water for more than 500,000 people in Toledo, Ohio. In 2016, a massive HAB in Florida's Lake Okeechobee negatively impacted tourism and aquatic life. HABs have been recorded in every state and have become a concern nationwide. Many types of algae can cause HABs in freshwater systems. The most frequent and severe blooms involve the proliferation of cyanobacteria. Some cyanobacteria species can produce toxins—cyanotoxins—that can cause mild to severe health effects in humans and kill aquatic life and other animals. HABs can also contribute to deteriorating water quality and ecosystem health. As masses of cyanobacteria or other algae die and decompose, they consume oxygen, sometimes forming \"dead zones\" where life cannot survive. These areas can kill fish and organisms, such as crabs and clams, and have detrimental economic effects. Scientists widely consider nutrient enrichment to be a key cause of HAB formation. While nutrients are essential to plants and natural parts of aquatic ecosystems, excessive amounts can overstimulate algal growth. Sources include point sources (e.g., municipal wastewater discharges) and nonpoint sources (e.g., fertilizer runoff from agricultural and urban areas). Congress, federal agencies, and states have taken steps to address HABs and nutrients that contribute to their occurrence. The Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 (HABHRCA), as amended, established an interagency task force, required the task force to prepare reports and plans addressing marine and freshwater HABs, and authorized funding for research, education, monitoring activities, etc. In December 2016, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) used its authority under the Clean Water Act (CWA) to propose water quality criteria for two algal toxins in waters used for recreational purposes. States use such criteria when developing water quality standards—measures that describe the desired condition or level of protection of a water body and what is needed for protection. Further, EPA has emphasized the need to reduce nutrient pollution from all sources to reduce public health and environmental impacts associated with HABs. The CWA does not authorize EPA to regulate all sources. It authorizes EPA to regulate point (direct) sources of nutrients but does not authorize EPA to regulate nonpoint (diffuse) sources of nutrient pollution. Some states have developed guidelines for algal toxins, primarily for use in guiding swimming advisories. Also, states have listed waters as impaired, or not meeting water quality standards, for algal blooms or algal toxins. Some of these states have begun to develop Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs)—essentially pollution budgets—to address them. Most states have identified nutrient-related pollution as a priority to be addressed by their TMDLs and/or alternative restoration plans. States rely heavily on financial assistance from EPA in implementing these plans and, more broadly, in addressing nonpoint source pollution that leads to degraded water quality and HAB formation. Congress has long provided financial assistance through EPA for regional, state, and local programs through CWA Sections 106 and 319 planning grants, geographic programs (such as the Chesapeake Bay and Great Lakes), and other sources. The President's FY2019 budget request for most of these programs is either eliminated or significantly reduced. Congress continues to show interest in addressing HABs. This interest has largely focused on funding research to close research gaps identified by scientists and decisionmakers and to coordinate the efforts of federal agencies and their partners to study and address HABs.", "prediction": "In addition to HAB-specific legislation, the Clean Water Act (CWA) authorizes EPA to address water quality concerns associated with HABs. According to EPA documents, approximately 30 states have implemented cyanobacterial HAB guidelines for recreational waterways as of November 2015. In 2013, EPA outlined barriers to numeric nutrient criteria implementation and actions to help states address them."}
{"index": 2, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "The DATA Act became law in May 2014 and holds considerable promise for shedding more light on how federal funds are spent. To improve the transparency and quality of the federal spending data made available to the public, the DATA Act directed OMB and Treasury to establish government-wide data standards that include common data elements for reporting financial and payment information by May 2015. Under the act, federal agencies must begin reporting financial spending data using these standards by May 2017 and publicly post spending data in a machine- readable format by May 2018. The DATA Act also requires that OMB, or an agency it designates, establish a pilot program to facilitate the development of recommendations to (1) standardize reporting elements across the federal government, (2) eliminate unnecessary duplication in financial reporting, and (3) reduce compliance costs for recipients of federal awards. The act established reporting requirements and timeframes for implementation of the pilot. See figure 1 for a timeline of these deadlines. The DATA Act also sets specific requirements related to the pilot’s design. First, the pilot must collect data during a 12-month reporting cycle. The pilot must also include a diverse group of recipients such as awardees receiving a range of awards as long as the total value of the awards falls within the statutory range. To the extent practicable, the pilot is to include recipients who receive federal awards from multiple programs across multiple agencies. Finally, the pilot must include a combination of federal contracts, grants, and subawards with an aggregate value between $1 billion and $2 billion. In addition, OMB must review the information recipients are required to report to identify common reporting elements across the federal government, unnecessary duplication in financial reporting, and unnecessarily burdensome reporting requirements for recipients of federal awards. This review is to be done in consultation with relevant federal agencies and recipients of federal awards, including state and local governments and institutions of higher education. A well-developed and documented pilot program can help ensure that agency assessments produce information needed to make effective program and policy decisions. Such a process enhances the quality, credibility, and usefulness of evaluations in addition to helping to ensure that time and resources are used effectively. We have identified five leading practices that, taken together, form a framework for effective pilot design. To identify these practices, we reviewed our prior work as well as academic literature related to the design of pilot and evaluation programs. By following these leading practices, agencies can promote a consistent and effective pilot design process. We shared these practices with OMB, HHS, and GSA staff, who found them to be reasonable and appropriate, and applicable to the Section 5 Pilot. 1. Establish well-defined, appropriate, clear, and measurable objectives. Such objectives should have specific statements of the accomplishments necessary to meet the objectives. Clear and measurable objectives can help ensure that appropriate evaluation data are collected from the outset of pilot implementation so that data will subsequently be available to measure performance against the objectives. Broad study objectives should be translated into specific, researchable questions that articulate what will be assessed. 2. Clearly articulate assessment methodology and data gathering strategy that addresses all components of the pilot program and includes key features of a sound plan. Key features of a clearly articulated methodology include a strategy for comparing the pilot implementation and results with other efforts, a clear plan that details the type and source of the data necessary to evaluate the pilot, and methods for data collection including the timing and frequency. 3. Identify criteria or standards for identifying lessons about the pilot to inform decisions about scalability and whether, how, and when to integrate pilot activities into overall efforts. The purpose of a pilot is generally to inform a decision on whether and how to implement a new approach in a broader context. Therefore, it is critically important to consider how well the lessons learned from the pilot can be applied in other, broader settings. To assess scalability, criteria should relate to the similarity or comparability of the pilot to the range of circumstances and population expected in full implementation. The criteria or standards can be based on lessons from past experiences or other related efforts known to influence implementation and performance as well as on literature reviews and stakeholder input, among other sources. The criteria and standards should be observable and measureable events, actions, or characteristics that provide evidence that the pilot objectives have been met. Choosing well-regarded criteria against which to make comparisons can lead to strong, defensible conclusions. 4. Develop a detailed data-analysis plan to track the pilot program’s implementation and performance and evaluate the final results of the project and draw conclusions on whether, how, and when to integrate pilot activities into overall efforts. A detailed data-analysis plan identifies who will do the analysis as well as when and how data will be analyzed to measure the pilot program’s implementation and performance. The results will show the successes and challenges of the pilot, and in turn, how the pilot can be incorporated into broader efforts. Some elements of a detailed data-analysis plan include talking to users, managers, and developers; evaluating the lessons learned to improve procedures moving forward; and other appropriate measures. 5. Ensure appropriate two-way stakeholder communication and input at all stages of the pilot project, including design, implementation, data gathering, and assessment Appropriate two-way stakeholder communication and input should occur at all stages of the pilot, including design, implementation, data gathering, and assessment. Failure to effectively engage with stakeholders, and understand and address their views can undermine or derail an initiative. To that end, it is critical that agencies identify who the relevant stakeholders are, and communicate early and often to address their concerns and convey the initiative’s overarching benefits. OMB has established a Section 5 Pilot with two primary focus areas—one on federal grants and another on federal contracts (procurement). OMB’s Office of Federal Financial Management is responsible for the grants portion of the pilot and has designated the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to serve as its executing agent. On the contracting side, OMB’s OFPP is responsible for leading the procurement portion and is working with various entities including 18F and the Chief Acquisitions Officers’ Council (CAOC). Specifically, 18F is designing the system to be tested as part of the pilot. GSA’s Office of Government-wide Policy is responsible for providing federal register notices; and its Integrated Award Environment provides guidance and technical considerations. OMB launched a number of pilot-related initiatives in May 2015 and expects to continue activities until at least May 2017. As the executing agent for the grants portion of the pilot, HHS has developed six “test models” that will evaluate different approaches to potentially reducing grantee reporting burden. These six models are the specific grants tools, forms, or processes that will be tested and analyzed under the pilot to determine if adopting these changes will actually contribute to the program’s objectives of reducing reporting burden, duplication, and compliance costs. Taken as a whole, the six test models examine a variety of grant reporting issues that HHS has identified as presenting challenges. HHS officials told us that they have received comments through the National Dialogue, a website for grant recipients and contractors to discuss issues including compliance costs, reporting burden, eliminating duplication, and standardizing processes. In addition, the officials obtained feedback on areas of concern from grantees involved in earlier HHS efforts to streamline grants reporting. They used that information to inform the development of the six test models. Officials from advocacy groups representing grant recipients and federal contractors told us that they initially expected the grants portion of the pilot to be an extension of the Grants Reporting Information Project (GRIP) proof of concept that was launched following the enactment of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 rather than the six test models. HHS officials told us they would have liked to more fully replicate the GRIP, however, that would have required broader participation from agencies than was available for the Section 5 Pilot. The following provides high-level summaries of each of the six test models. For additional details, see appendix II. HHS intends to assess whether an online and searchable repository for data standards will facilitate grant reporting. To do this, HHS developed the Common Data Element Repository (CDER) Library, which is intended to be an authorized source for data elements and definitions for use by the federal government and recipients reporting grant information. The CDER Library is also intended to encourage the use of common definitions for grants-related terms by nonfederal stakeholders and federal agencies. As of March 2016, the publicly-available version of the CDER Library contained 112 data elements from a variety of sources, including the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), OMB Circular A-11, and the Uniform Grant Guidance. It also included several data elements standardized in accordance with DATA Act requirements. HHS has developed a version of the CDER Library, accessible only to federal agencies, that contains a much more detailed database of more than 9,000 elements. This federal-agency-only version of the CDER Library also identifies which grant reporting forms these data elements come from so that users can see how many forms require the same data element and which agencies request that information from grantees. HHS officials told us that they believe the CDER Library has the potential to be a powerful tool for streamlining definitions and forms. HHS intends to test whether it will be possible to use a consolidated Federal Financial Report (FFR) to allow grantees to submit multiple reporting forms into one system. The FFR, reported on the Standard Form 425, is used for reporting grants expenditures for the recipients of federal assistance. HHS believes that a consolidated FFR will allow participants to submit complete information once instead of through multiple entry points. A consolidated FFR could provide a single point of data entry, earlier validation of FFR data, and potential future streamlining of the grants close-out process. According to HHS officials, this test model is intended to be a continuation of the GRIP launched during the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The aim of that effort was to determine the feasibility of developing a centralized government-wide collection system for federal agencies and recipients of federal awards. HHS is examining ways to reduce duplicate and redundant information contained in Single Audit forms. The Single Audit Act requires states, local governments, and nonprofit organizations expending $750,000 or more in federal awards in a year to obtain an audit in accordance with the requirements set forth in the act. HHS intends to test whether some grant forms related to the single audit could be combined. HHS plans to examine whether a consolidated Notice of Award coversheet might reduce reporting burden by allowing grant recipients to locate required reporting data in one place, rather than attempting to find information on coversheets that differ by agency. HHS added a new section to the Grants.gov website, called Learn Grants, intended to make it easier for stakeholders to find, learn about, and apply for federal grants. The Learn Grants website provides links to grant policies, processes, funding, and other grant lifecycle information. HHS officials said they want to use this test model to determine whether the Learn Grants site could effectively engage stakeholders and provide training early in the grants lifecycle process that, in turn, would have a positive effect on recipient compliance during post-award activities. The procurement portion of the pilot will be focused on examining the feasibility of centralizing the reporting of certain required information. Depending on the contract, there may be many types of information contractors must report. OFPP staff told us the pilot will initially focus on the reporting of certified payroll. This is one specific FAR requirement only applicable to contracts for construction within the United States. Specifically, OFPP has identified opportunities to improve upon the current unstandardized reporting format under which some employers report data electronically while others use manual paper processes. Further, OFPP intends to identify which data elements would be included in reporting, the method of data transmission, and other related details. This narrow approach stands in contrast to the grants portion of the pilot where HHS has a broader, more comprehensive plan to explore several areas where grantee reporting burden might be reduced. OFPP staff explained that its decision to focus on certified payroll reporting arose out of feedback from the procurement community. They also noted that the Section 5 Pilot is one of a number of government-wide initiatives to reduce contractor burden and streamline procurement processes, such as GSA’s Integrated Award Environment initiative to integrate acquisition systems into one streamlined environment. To better understand the issue of certified payroll reporting and its potential suitability as a subject for the procurement portion of the Section 5 Pilot, the CAOC engaged GSA’s 18F through an interagency agreement to interview contractors, contracting officers, business owners, government employees, and subject-matter experts (SME). As a result of that effort, 18F identified major categories of burdens and constraints related to certified payroll reporting and potential recommendations on how to address them. OFPP staff said they once again worked with 18F in winter 2016 to gather requirements for building a prototype system to centralize the reporting of certified payroll data. The 18F staff we spoke with noted that they will build a prototype to explore potential solutions for reducing contractor burden through user research and testing. OFPP staff will develop and evaluate metrics for the pilot. OFPP intends to test the system in summer 2016. In May 2015, OMB, CAOC, GSA, and HHS launched the National Dialogue, a website for grant recipients and federal contractors to discuss issues including compliance costs, reporting burden, eliminating duplication, and standardizing processes. OMB staff told us that they used the National Dialogue as a feedback mechanism for the grants and procurement portions of the pilot. This was one of the first publicly announced pilot-related activities. The website will accept comments through May 2017. OMB and GSA staff told us that they plan to actively review and address the input they receive. The website is intended to be a useful tool for obtaining information about issues of concern to their respective communities. Discussions related to grantee reporting have been significantly more active than those focused on procurement. Although the comments vary widely in topic, there are a number of substantive suggestions for how grantee reporting burdens can be reduced. While HHS officials told us that the dialogue was intentionally designed so that feedback would be submitted anonymously, some commenters have self-identified the institution they represent, including the Council on Governmental Relations, Association on American Universities, Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, and Coalition for Government Procurement. If HHS effectively implements its stated plans for the grants portion of the Section 5 Pilot, it is likely that the grants portion of the pilot will comply with the act. These requirements call for the grants portion’s design to include the following: DATA Act Requirement 1: Collect data during a 12-month reporting cycle. HHS’s November 2015 design documentation shows that it will begin collecting data for these six test models by May 2016. This would allow for data to be collected on these test models during a 12-month reporting cycle before May 2017, when the pilot is required to terminate. We believe these timeframes should provide sufficient time for HHS to incorporate public comments by May 2016 and allow for a full 12-month data collection cycle. DATA Act Requirement 2: Include a diverse group of federal award recipients and, to the extent practicable, recipients who receive federal awards from multiple programs across multiple agencies. HHS officials told us that they have developed a detailed plan to select participants, which will include state and local governments, universities, and other types of grant recipients. HHS officials explained that the grants portion of the pilot will include recipients who received a range of federal funding amounts and will not be limited to one agency or grant program. HHS officials initially told us that they could not provide us with the revised plan because it was still under review by OMB. We did receive a copy of the revised plan at the end of March 2016, but because of the timing we were unable to fully review it in time for the release of this report. We will provide our assessment of the plan as part of future work as we continue to monitor the design and implementation of the Section 5 Pilot. DATA Act Requirement 3: Include a combination of federal contracts, grants, and subawards, with an aggregate value of not less than $1 billion but not more than $2 billion. HHS officials told us that they are still determining how to meet the requirement for total award value because they want to ensure the pool of pilot participants is as diverse and large as possible while still being legally compliant. Specifically, one of their selection considerations is the award value of grants received by awardees. Further, HHS officials have explored strategies to ensure that they do not exceed the maximum dollar amount threshold. HHS officials told us that they expect to make decisions related to how to meet this requirement in early 2016. We have concerns about the extent that the design of the procurement portion of the pilot reflects the requirements specified in the DATA Act. OFPP’s plans to address those statutory design requirements discussed below reflect the status of the procurement portion of the pilot described by OFPP staff and related documents we reviewed. DATA Act Requirement 1: Collect data during a 12-month reporting cycle. The design of the procurement portion of the pilot is at risk of not including data collected during a 12-month reporting cycle in a meaningful way. To meet this requirement, OFPP and GSA would need to begin collecting data no later than May 9, 2016. When we spoke with OFPP staff, they stated that by launching the National Dialogue in May 2015, they believe they will have met the act’s requirements that data collection take place during a 12-month reporting cycle. Further, staff also considered comments received from other efforts including the Open Dialogue on Improving How to Do Business with the Federal Government conducted in 2014 to meet this requirement. However, neither of these dialogues included comments that specifically mentioned the issue of certified payroll. As a result, we do not believe those comments provide meaningful and relevant data on the effectiveness of a centralized portal for certified payroll reporting. As a result of design and development delays, OFPP will not be able to collect meaningful and useful data for the procurement portion of the pilot until summer 2016, when it expects to complete the development of a centralized portal through which participants will submit certified payroll data. OFPP started exploring ways to streamline certified payroll reporting in spring 2015. OFPP said that due to staffing challenges, work on designing a prototype for a system to be tested under the pilot did not begin until late February 2016. At that time, the CAOC signed an agreement with GSA’s 18F to begin what it expected to be a 10-week design period. Cognizant staff expect this design work will take place between March and May 2016. However, a contractor cannot begin building an actual “production” version of the system to be tested under the pilot until 18F designs the prototype, which is expected to be completed by the beginning of May 2016. Therefore, this leaves at most a few weeks to develop the centralized reporting portal before May 9, 2016—the date which the pilot must begin for meaningful and useful data to be collected in a full 12- month period. OFPP staff told us that they do not intend to begin testing a centralized reporting portal until late summer 2016. According to OFPP and GSA staff, they were faced with delays due to bid protests related to the contracting mechanism GSA intends to use to select a contractor to build the portal to be tested under the pilot. However, as of March 2016, these bid protests have been resolved and no longer present a barrier in awarding the contract. While we agree that these protests could pose a barrier to awarding the contract to develop the testing portal, we do not believe that OFPP needed to wait until they were resolved before moving forward with 18F’s development of a prototype for the portal. Given the resolution of these bid protests, OFPP staff said that they are working with 18F to assess the feasibility of expediting project timelines to launch the prototype sooner than expected so that they could potentially collect 10 months of data through the certified payroll reporting portal. Given the weekly or bi-weekly reporting of certified payroll, this approach may result in a sufficient amount of meaningful and useful data on which OFPP can base conclusions related to its hypothesis. However, it is important that OFPP clearly conveys and documents its rationale for how its approach will contribute to the collection of meaningful and useful data consistent with the timeframes established under the act. DATA Act Requirement 2: Include a diverse group of federal award recipients and, to the extent practicable, recipients who receive federal awards from multiple programs across multiple agencies. OFPP and GSA do not yet have a detailed plan for selecting participants that will result in a diverse group of recipients with awards from multiple programs and agencies. However, there is some documentation related to OFPP’s approach for selecting participants in the project plan and in a Federal Register notice issued on November 24, 2015. For example, the draft plan identifies the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation as the mechanism that will be used for identifying which contracts and contractors to include in the pilot. OFPP staff also told us that they intend to cover both large and small industries. While valuable information, these documents do not clearly convey how the procurement portion of the pilot would specifically contribute to meeting the act’s requirement regarding diversity of participants. OFPP staff told us that for the purposes of meeting the pilot requirements they consider any individual or group that provided information to the National Dialogue to be a participant in the pilot. However, as previously mentioned, individuals and groups that have commented on the National Dialogue did not provide any comments related to certified payroll. Therefore, it is unclear how they could be considered pilot participants. Additionally, OFPP staff were unable to tell us how they plan to count commenters that are not contract awardees, but instead are organizations representing groups of federal contractors. It is unclear how OFPP can ensure the universe of commenters is diverse because it does not control who comments on the dialogue. OFPP staff stated that they also intend to select participants for testing their prototype system using a nongeneralizable sample of contractor data reported through the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation. However, they did not provide us with specific information on how they would ensure that the sample met all requirements under the act, nor did they provide a detailed, documented sampling plan equivalent to the grants portion of the pilot. As a result, it will be important for OFPP to clearly document its rationale for how its approach will allow for the inclusion of a diverse group of federal contractors, as required by the act. DATA Act Requirement 3: Include a combination of federal contracts, grants, and subawards, with an aggregate value of not less than $1 billion but not more than $2 billion. OFPP staff told us OMB could meet this dollar range requirement through the grants and procurement portions of the pilot collectively. Under such an approach, it would be important for each portion of the pilot to know how much it is contributing to meet the required award range. Our understanding of the grants portion of the pilot suggests that that it has a plan for doing this. Less apparent are the specifics of how the procurement portion of the pilot would do so. We assessed the designs of the grants and procurement portions of the pilot against leading practices that we identified from our prior work and other sources. In continuation of our constructive engagement approach for working with agencies implementing the DATA Act, we shared the results of our analysis with HHS and OFPP staff who told us that they will consider our input as they continue to update and revise their plans. HHS’s November 2015 design for the grants portion of the pilot generally applied leading practices. As noted above, while we have received a revised plan for the design of the grants portion, we were unable to fully review it in time for the release of this report. We will provide our assessment of that plan in a forthcoming review that will focus on the pilot’s implementation. DATA Act Grants Test Models Under the Office of Management and Budget’s (OMB) direction, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) intends to develop recommendations for reducing grantee reporting burden by testing different areas. HHS will develop and test: An online repository for data elements and definitions that is intended to be an authoritative source for data elements and definitions, called the Common Data Element Repository (CDER) Library. A federal agency-only version of the CDER Library containing more than 9,000 grants data elements that identify which specific grant forms these data elements come from, so that users can see how many forms require the same data element and which agencies request that information. Leading Practice 1: Establish Well-Defined, Appropriate, Clear, and Measurable Objectives. Each of the six grants test models at least partially met the leading practice that pilots have well-defined, appropriate, clear, and measurable objectives. For example, one of the Single Audit test models has the clearly defined objective of testing whether two forms containing duplicative information can be combined to reduce recipient reporting burden. This objective is measurable and appropriately linked to the purposes of the Section 5 Pilot overall, which include eliminating unnecessary duplication in financial reporting and reducing compliance costs for recipients of federal awards. In another example, one of the CDER Library test models has a clearly established objective of determining whether access to an authoritative source for common data element definitions would help grant recipients complete necessary forms accurately and in a timely manner. The CDER Library test model also identifies specific metrics that would allow them to measure whether they are able to achieve its stated objectives. In our initial review of these test models, we provided feedback to HHS that the other CDER Library test did not have a clear, fully established objective. In response, HHS officials explained that the objective of that test model is to compare data elements and forms used across the federal government with the goal of consolidating these forms and ultimately passing on reporting efficiencies to grant recipients. Leading Practice 2: Clearly Articulate an Assessment Methodology. Five of the six test models did not clearly articulate an assessment methodology. In contrast, for the Learn Grants test model, HHS described how it planned to use webinars, conference presentations, and other events to increase awareness inside and outside of government about the grants-related resources available on Grants.gov. The plan also includes a detailed timeline for executing the test model, as well as HHS’s methodology for conducting pre- and post-tests of pilot participants. HHS officials told us that they worked with a federal SME with previous experience working on Grants.gov to help develop and refine the assessment methodology. The remaining five test models have less clearly articulated assessment methodologies. For example, for the consolidated FFR test model, HHS said it will survey grant recipients on their experiences when submitting their reports into one system rather than multiple entry points; but we found that the plans lacked detail about how surveys will be designed and administered. In addition, the plan did not provide specific information about the participants HHS intends to survey, nor did it provide details regarding how HHS will compare survey results for recipients in the pilot versus those not participating in the pilot. In meetings with senior HHS officials, we raised these and similar concerns about the Notice of Award test model and one of the CDER Library models. For the other CDER Library test model, we found that HHS’s plans did not identify the data sources or metrics that would be used in the assessment methodology. In those feedback meetings, HHS officials said many of the concerns have been addressed in the revised plan. Leading Practice 3: Ensure Scalability of Pilot Design. HHS documented an overall structure for how each test model is integrated into the overall grants portion of the pilot. However, the documented design lacks specific details about how HHS intends to evaluate the performance of each test model to inform decisions about scalability. Specifically, five of the six test models include either no or few specifics about how any observed reduction in burden could be generalizable beyond the context of the pilot. For example, HHS’s plan for the consolidated FFR test model indicates that it will be tested using grantees who receive awards from the Administration for Children and Families (ACF), a subunit of HHS. However, the plan does not specify how ACF will select participants or how results from ACF grant recipients can be applied government-wide. HHS officials told us that ACF has a list of potential participants. Given the size and complexity of ACF’s grant recipients, the officials believed that these participants would provide a good basis for scalability should the FFR test model prove to be successful. According to HHS officials, they have developed a comprehensive sampling plan for selecting participants for each of the six test models. They will reach out to selected participants to begin data collection in May 2016. We have recently been provided with the draft sampling plan and will provide our assessment of it in our forthcoming review on the implementation of the Section 5 Pilot. Leading Practice 4: Develop a Plan to Evaluate Pilot Results. The design for five of HHS’s six test models provides some level of detail on how it plans to evaluate pilot results. For instance, HHS’s Learn Grants test model provides a description of a methodology to measure knowledge about the grants lifecycle. It will compare a group of recipients that has access to certain grant resources contained in a public on-line portal to another group of recipients that does not. HHS’s plans indicate that the results from both tests will be analyzed to evaluate knowledge gained by participants to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the Learn Grants tab on the Grants.gov website. However, the documented pilot design lacks specific detail on how HHS plans to analyze the data it gathered and how it will draw conclusions about integrating the pilot activities into overall grant reporting efforts. For example, both CDER Library test models reference an analysis plan for evaluating to see if burden has been reduced. The plans do not indicate how HHS would determine if a particular time threshold represents a true reduction in burden and whether that burden is measured in minutes, hours, or some other unit of analysis. Similarly, the Single Audit and Notice of Award test models indicate that HHS will use results from surveys and focus groups, including documenting benefits and challenges raised by participants; yet HHS’s plans for these two test models do not specify how HHS will compile these results and distill them into actionable recommendations. HHS officials told us that their revised planning documents are to include this additional level of detail to address our concerns. Leading Practice 5: Ensure Appropriate Two-Way Stakeholder Communication. HHS has engaged in two-way stakeholder communications for all six of its test models. It also has taken a number of actions to obtain input from grant recipients including posting questions on the National Dialogue to solicit feedback on how to ease grantee reporting burden. Further, HHS has been involved in a number of outreach activities including presentations at conferences, town hall events, and webinars to identify areas of reporting burden and duplication, and to collect ideas to streamline reporting. HHS also used these forums to provide updates on the progress of the design and specific information on the six test models. HHS supplemented input received through the National Dialogue with feedback from SME to help design the test models. An HHS official told us they identified SMEs based on their experience working with federal grants, grant recipients, and systems being tested. HHS officials provided several examples of how they engaged in two-way communication with stakeholders when developing their test models. For example, HHS consulted with a federal official who used to work for Grants.gov to help develop the Learn Grants test model and the pre- and post-test evaluations associated with it. For the FFR test model, HHS consulted with officials who work in ACF and the Payment Management System. HHS also worked with other SMEs from across the federal government to develop other test models. According to a HHS official, SMEs were asked to critically assess the methodology for each of the models with the intent of making each model more effective. More recently, in January 2016, HHS pre-tested proposed Section 5 Pilot test models and obtained feedback on ways to improve them with advocacy groups representing those in the grants recipient communities including state and local governments as well as research universities. Also included were representatives from the auditing and software development industries. HHS officials told us that they have made significant revisions in response to the pre-tests and feedback to their documented design. However, HHS has additional opportunities to foster two-way dialogue with recipients of federal funds. Officials from advocacy groups representing federal funding recipients told us that they are still waiting for information about how their membership can be more engaged in the pilot process. For example, an official from the National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers, and Treasurers told us that following a webinar for their membership hosted by the Association of Government Accountants in November 2015 on the Section 5 Pilot, they collected the names of more than 20 state and local government representatives who were interested in participating in the grants portion of the pilot. This official said the names were given to HHS, but the association has not received any information on how these volunteers can participate in the pilot. HHS officials said that once they receive OMB approval on their sampling methodology for selecting participants, they will be able to reach out to those who expressed interest in being a part of the pilot. We provided our assessment of the design of the grants portion of the pilot to HHS officials, who told us that they generally concurred with our analysis and had updated their plan to address many of these concerns. As noted above, we did not have time to review this update in this report because we did not receive the plan in time. For details of our assessment of the design of the six grants test models, see appendix II. Based on our review of the working draft plan for the procurement portion of the pilot dated November 2015, related documents, and interviews with cognizant staff, we found that the design did not reflect leading practices for pilot design. Further, while the plan included some information regarding responsibilities of stakeholders involved in the procurement portion of the pilot, specific roles and deliverables were not clearly described for all phases of the pilot. For example, the written draft plan listed broad areas of responsibilities—such as “manage funding” or “Federal Register Notice”—but did not detail what stakeholders would be working on related to those activities. OFPP staff described additional actions to supplement the information contained in the draft plan. This information included their decision to initially focus the design of the procurement pilot on testing the feasibility of centralizing certified payroll reporting by contractors subject to the Davis-Bacon and related acts because of public feedback on the need to reduce duplicate reporting. However, even after taking this additional information into account, we found that the design was neither well- developed nor documented in accordance with leading practices to allow for the development of effective recommendations to simplify reporting for contractors, as described below. Leading Practice 1: Establish Well-Defined, Appropriate, Clear, and Measurable Objectives. The working draft plan provided by OFPP does not include specifics pertaining to the proposed focus of certified payroll reporting. OFPP staff told us that they believe submitting certified payroll information through a centralized portal would reduce contractor reporting burden. They explained that this topic was selected because they learned that it was a particular pain point for contractors as a result of various outreach efforts including 18F’s discovery process. The draft plan also does not provide specifics regarding the particular objectives and hypothesis that will be tested by the pilot. OFPP staff stated that, consistent with their view of agile practices, they intend to further refine their approach as 18F develops its prototype and additional work proceeds with the pilot. Leading Practice 2: Clearly Articulate an Assessment Methodology. The draft plan we reviewed did not include detailed information on the methodology, strategy, or types of data planned to be collected. The draft plan referenced an information-gathering effort conducted by GSA’s 18F to discover challenges and develop recommendations for burden reduction. However, OFPP staff could not provide any evidence that this effort resulted in specific methodologies or data-collection strategies related to centralizing certified payroll reporting. According to 18F staff, a second phase of the procurement portion of the pilot will begin in March 2016. OFPP staff said that during this phase, 18F will research, design, and test a prototype that will become a basis for the centralized portal that will be tested under the pilot. This prototype will be vetted in workshops with stakeholders who will test, among other things, the metrics, functionality, and accessibility of the prototype and any needed changes. 18F expects the second phase to be completed by May 2016, after which OFPP will begin the third phase of the pilot later this summer. In that phase, a contractor will develop a centralized portal based on 18F’s design that could be used to test the submission and review of certified payroll data. Additionally, OFPP staff told us that they intended to collect data in accordance with FAR requirements and would compare the information collected in the portal with that being submitted through other methods. However, OFPP was not able to provide specific details on its pilot methodology, such as how it intends to compare results of contractors that use the prototype and those that do not, identify the type and source of data necessary to evaluate the pilot, and establish the timing and frequency of the data to be collected. Without these details, the procurement methodology design does not address all components of a pilot program nor does it include key design features that would meet leading practices. Leading Practice 3: Ensure Scalability of Pilot Design. The draft design of the procurement portion of the pilot that we reviewed did not address the issue of scalability or efforts to ensure that conclusions and recommendations resulting from the pilot could be applied government- wide. However, OFPP staff indicated that they plan to develop a sampling approach that will allow them to collect data from a population that is representative of federal contractors. Specifically, they said that they will select a diverse group of participants by potentially pulling data from the Federal Procurement Data System-Next Generation. Using that database, they expect to be able to select a range of small and large contractors that are required to report certified payroll under Davis-Bacon and related acts. However, without documentation providing details of a sampling methodology, measures, and a data analysis plan, the design cannot ensure the scalability of the results or findings from the pilot. Leading Practice 4: Develop Plan to Evaluate Pilot Results. The draft procurement plan does not indicate how data will be evaluated to track program performance, how final results will be evaluated, or conclusions drawn. OFPP staff told us that although they believe it is early in the process to have finalized evaluation plans, they are considering a number of options for evaluating whether a centralized certified payroll portal would cost more or less than current reporting approaches. Specifically, they said that they expect to have some quantifiable data to allow for straightforward analysis and will evaluate the qualitative data from the certified payroll portal as well as the National Dialogue. However, the absence of a detailed data analysis plan suggests that OFPP lacks a sound approach to evaluate pilot results. Leading Practice 5: Ensure Appropriate Two-Way Stakeholder Communication. OFPP’s plans for obtaining stakeholder input and fostering two-way dialogue have not yet been developed to engage public participation and feedback on its approach for designing and implementing the procurement portion of the pilot. Similar to the approach taken by HHS, OFPP staff told us that they used comments posted on the National Dialogue to inform the design of the procurement portion. However, as previously mentioned, we have concerns about the usefulness of that approach because none of the three comments they received on the dialogue were related to certified payroll. OFPP staff said they also used comments posted on the 2014 open dialogue on improving procurement processes to inform their pilot design. From commentary posted on both sites, OFPP identified certified payroll reporting as a pain point that could be further explored through the pilot project. OFPP staff told us that they engaged GSA’s 18F to conduct the discovery phase of the pilot design to better understand areas of significant reporting burden related to certified payroll with a select group of stakeholders that included contractors, federal agency officials, and contracting officers. A Federal Register notice was also issued on November 24, 2015 to solicit public comments on the reporting burden of the procurement portion of the pilot under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Although OFPP obtained stakeholder input to identify areas of focus for the design of the procurement portion of the pilot, it has not engaged them to solicit input on other stages of the pilot, including design, implementation, data gathering, and assessment. Further, OFPP has not released specific information about the design of the pilot, nor has it made information about pilot participation available to stakeholders despite repeated requests for information from those participating in monthly calls hosted by the Association for Government Accountants and Treasury. In addition to being a leading practice for pilot design, our previous work examining grants management streamlining initiatives found that stakeholder communication is not just “pushing the message out,” but should also facilitate a two-way, honest exchange and allow for feedback from relevant stakeholders. We found that a lack of opportunities to provide timely feedback resulted in poor implementation and prioritization of streamlining initiatives and limited recipients’ use and understanding of new systems. As such, it will be important for OFPP to engage with the procurement community on its pilot design so that it can be improved based on public input. In addition, more effective two-way communications could also be a strategy for recruiting participants for the procurement portion of the pilot. In crafting the DATA Act, Congress sought to reduce the burden and cost of reporting for the recipients of federal funds. Toward that end, OMB, partnering with other federal agencies, has taken steps to design the Section 5 Pilot that will explore potential ways to reduce the burden and cost of reporting on federal funds for both the federal grantee and procurement communities. However, we found uneven progress in the grants and procurement portions of the pilot. OMB and HHS have made considerable progress designing an overall approach that will examine a variety of potential ways to simplify reporting for grant recipients. In addition to generally being on track to meet the specific requirements set out in the act, we found that the proposed design of the grants portion of the pilot partially adheres to leading practices. In contrast, our review of the design of the procurement portion of the pilot raises several concerns. In the absence of a detailed design and risk management plans for executing the pilot moving forward, it is unclear how the design of the procurement portion will reflect the requirements set forth by section 5 of the act. Because of project delays to date, it will be especially important for OMB to communicate to Congress and interested stakeholders how it plans to address key aspects of these requirements, such as the collection of meaningful and useful data over a 12-month reporting cycle and including a diverse group of participants with federal contracts totaling from $1 billion to $2 billion. Moreover, the design we reviewed for the procurement portion of the pilot did not reflect leading practices to allow for the development of effective recommendations to simplify reporting for contractors. Moving forward, given the tight timelines set out in the act, it will be important for OMB to redouble its focus on the design and implementation of the procurement portion. Without a sound design that applies leading practices, the recommendations to Congress for reducing reporting burden for contractors coming out of this effort may be late, of limited use, or incomplete. 1. To help ensure and more clearly convey how the procurement portion of the pilot will contribute to meeting the Section 5 Pilot design requirements, we recommend that the Director of OMB determine and clearly document (1) how it will collect certified payroll data over a 12-month reporting cycle, (2) ensure the diversity of pilot participants, and (3) how the inclusion of federal contracts will contribute to an aggregate amount of $1 billion to $2 billion. 2. To enable the development of effective recommendations for reducing reporting burden for contractors, the Director of OMB should ensure that the procurement portion of the pilot reflects leading practices for pilot design. We provided a draft of this report to OMB, HHS, and GSA for review and comment. OMB and HHS provided technical comments that we have incorporated throughout the report, as appropriate. OMB and HHS did not offer a view on our recommendations. GSA did not have any comments. We are sending copies of this report to the Director of OMB, Secretary of HHS, Administrator of GSA, and appropriate congressional addressees. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at https://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me on (202) 512-6806 or by email at sagerm@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. GAO staff who made key contributions to this report are listed in appendix III. This review (1) describes the administration’s approach to the Section 5 Pilot; (2) assesses whether current activities and plans will likely allow the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and its partners to meet requirements and time frames established under the Section 5 Pilot; and (3) evaluates the extent to which the design for the pilot is consistent with leading practices. To describe the administration’s approach to the pilot, we assessed documents related to pilot activities and interviewed OMB, Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and General Services Administration (GSA) officials and staff responsible for implementing the Section 5 Pilot. Specifically, we reviewed documentation from HHS and OMB’s Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP). Our reviews were based on the latest design plans available at the time. We also interviewed officials from organizations representing key non-federal stakeholders including state and local governments, private-sector contractors, and other federal fund recipients. To assess whether the Section 5 Pilot design would be likely to meet the statutory design requirements, we reviewed section 5 of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, as added by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act) to understand the deadlines and design requirements. We reviewed the draft design documents to assess OMB and its partners’ plans for meeting these requirements. To supplement our review of those plans, we also spoke with cognizant staff implementing these pilots at OMB, HHS, and GSA. To identify and analyze leading practices for pilot design, we reviewed our past work evaluating and assessing pilots. Additionally, we also relied on our technical guidance on designing evaluations. Further, we reviewed relevant studies from academia as well as other entities, such as the Brookings Institution and the Federal Demonstration Partnership. We reviewed reports from organizations that have expertise on conducting pilot programs and experience in scaling pilot results that could be applied government-wide. We also shared these leading practices with the agencies in this review during our audit work. To assess the extent to which the Section 5 Pilot design adhered to these leading practices, we reviewed documented designs and plans for both the grants and procurement portions of the pilot. To evaluate the grants portion of the pilot, we focused on a draft design document from November 2015. HHS officials told us that they have updated that plan. Because we did not receive this update until the end of March 2016, we did not have time to include its content for this report. As such, our assessment is based on the November 2015 plan. We intend to review the updated plan as we continue our work on DATA Act implementation. We have supplemented our assessment with information HHS officials provided to us during subsequent interviews, as appropriate. For the procurement portion, we reviewed a working draft plan from November 2015. While it is unclear whether there has been an updated version, we have also provided additional details from discussions with OFPP officials, as appropriate. To evaluate the grants and procurement portions of the pilot, we applied the five leading practices we identified to OMB and HHS’s design documents. Each of those assessments were subsequently verified by another individual. We determined that the design met the criteria when we saw evidence that all aspects of a leading practice were met. When we were unable to assess whether all aspects of a leading practice were met without additional information, we determined that the design partially met the criteria. Finally, when we saw no evidence of a leading practice, we determined that the criteria was not met. In continuation of our constructive engagement approach on the DATA Act for working with agencies implementing the act, we provided HHS and OMB with feedback on the design of the grants and procurement portions of the pilot during our review. These officials generally accepted our feedback and, in some instances, noted that they have or would make changes to their design as a result of our input. We conducted this performance audit from May 2015 to April 2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. This appendix provides detailed information regarding our assessment of the pilot design for the grants portion of the Section 5 Pilot. We assessed each of the Department of Health and Human Services’s (HHS) six test models against the five leading practices for pilot design described in the report. Using HHS’s November 2015 design plans and relevant supporting information available during the preparation of this report, we determined whether each test model met, partially met, or did not meet those leading practices. In addition to the contact named above, J. Christopher Mihm (Managing Director), Peter Del Toro (Assistant Director), Shirley Hwang (analyst-in- charge), Aaron Colsher, Kathleen Drennan, Jason Lyuke, Kiran Sreepada, and David Watsula made major contributions to this report. Other key contributors include Lisette Baylor, Brandon Booth, Jenny Chanley, Robert Gebhart, Donna Miller, Carl Ramirez, Andrew J. Stephens, and Tatiana Winger. Additional members of GAO’s DATA Act Internal Working Group also contributed to the development of this report.", "reference": "The DATA Act directs OMB or a designated federal agency to establish a pilot program to develop recommendations for simplifying federal award reporting for grants and contracts. The grants portion will test six ways to reduce recipient reporting burden while the procurement portion will initially focus on centralizing contractor reporting of certified payroll. The act requires GAO to review DATA Act implementation as it proceeds. This report (1) describes OMB's approach to the DATA Act pilot requirements, (2) assesses whether current plans and activities will likely allow OMB and its partners to meet the requirements under the act, and (3) evaluates the extent to which designs for the grants and procurement portions of the pilot are consistent with leading practices. GAO reviewed available pilot documentation; assessed them against leading practices for pilot design; and interviewed staff at OMB, HHS, and GSA, as well as groups representing recipients of federal grants and contracts. GAO will conduct a follow-on review focused on OMB's implementation of its pilot designs. As required by the Digital Accountability and Transparency Act of 2014 (DATA Act), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is conducting a pilot program, known as the Section 5 Pilot, aimed at developing recommendations for reducing recipient reporting burden for grantees and contractors. OMB partnered with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to design and implement the grants portion of the pilot, and with the General Services Administration (GSA) to implement the procurement portion. OMB launched the Section 5 Pilot in May 2015 and expects to continue pilot-related activities until at least May 2017. If implemented according to HHS's proposed plan, the grants portion of the pilot will likely meet the requirements established under the act. In contrast, GAO has concerns with how the procurement portion of the pilot will contribute to the Section 5 Pilot's design requirements. For example, OMB has not fully described how it will select pilot participants that will result in a diverse group of contractors as required by the act. OMB staff stated that they intend to select participants for testing the procurement pilot by using a nongeneralizable sample of contractor data, but they have not provided a detailed, documented sampling plan. The design of the grants portion of the pilot partially adhered to leading practices. Although five out of the six grants test models had clear and measurable objectives, only one had specific details about how potential findings could be scalable to be generalizable beyond the context of the pilot. HHS officials said they have updated their plan to address these concerns but that plan was not provided in time to allow GAO to analyze it for this review. The design of the procurement portion of the pilot did not reflect leading practices. For example, the plan did not include specific information on the methodology, strategy, or types of data to be collected. Further, the plan we reviewed did not address the extent to which the proposed pilot approach would be scalable to produce recommendations that could be applied government-wide. The design also did not indicate how data will be evaluated to draw conclusions. Finally, while OMB has solicited general comments related to contractor reporting pain points, it has not released specific details on the design to stakeholders despite their repeated requests for that information. GAO recommends that OMB (1) clearly document how the procurement portion of the pilot will contribute to the design requirements under the DATA Act and (2) ensure that the design of the procurement portion of the pilot reflects leading practices. OMB, HHS, and GSA did not comment on our recommendations. GAO incorporated technical comments from OMB and HHS where appropriate.", "prediction": "As the executing agent for the grants portion of the pilot, HHS has developed six “test models” that will evaluate different approaches to potentially reducing grantee reporting burden. Taken as a whole, the six test models examine a variety of grant reporting issues that HHS has identified as presenting challenges. We reviewed the draft design documents to assess OMB and its partners’ plans for meeting these requirements."}
{"index": 3, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Passenger screening is a process by which screeners inspect individuals and their property to deter and prevent an act of violence or air piracy, such as the carrying of any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, weapon, or other prohibited item on board an aircraft or into a sterile area. Screeners inspect individuals for prohibited items at designated screening locations. TSA developed standard operating procedures for screening passengers at airport checkpoints. Primary screening is conducted on all airline passengers before they enter the sterile area of an airport and involves passengers walking through a metal detector and carry-on items being subjected to X-ray screening. Passengers who alarm the walk-through metal detector or are designated as selectees—that is, passengers selected for additional screening—must then undergo secondary screening, as well as passengers whose carry-on items have been identified by the X-ray machine as potentially containing prohibited items. Secondary screening involves additional means for screening passengers, such as by hand- wand; physical pat-down; or, at certain airport locations, an explosives trace portal (ETP), which is used to detect traces of explosives on passengers by using puffs of air to dislodge particles from their bodies and clothing into an analyzer. Selectees’ carry-on items are also physically searched or screened for explosives, such as by using explosives trace detection machines. Federal agencies—particularly NCTC and the FBI—submit to TSC nominations of individuals to be included on the consolidated watchlist. For example, NCTC receives terrorist-related information from executive branch departments and agencies, such as the Department of State, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the FBI, and catalogs this information in its Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment database, commonly known as the TIDE database. This database serves as the U.S. government’s central classified database with information on known or suspected international terrorists. According to NCTC, agencies submit watchlist nomination reports to the center, but are not required to specify individual screening systems that they believe should receive the watchlist record, such as the No Fly list of individuals who are to be denied boarding an aircraft. NCTC is to presume that agency nominations are valid unless it has other information in its possession to rebut that position. To decide if a person poses enough of a threat to be placed on the watchlist, agencies are to follow Homeland Security Presidential Directive (HSPD) 6, which states that the watchlist is to contain information about individuals “known or appropriately suspected to be or have been engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to terrorism.” HSPD-24 definitively established the “reasonable suspicion” standard for watchlisting by providing that agencies are to make available to other agencies all biometric information associated with “persons for whom there is an articulable and reasonable basis for suspicion that they pose a threat to national security.” NCTC is to consider information from all available sources and databases to determine if there is a reasonable suspicion of links to terrorism that warrants a nomination, which can involve some level of subjectivity. The guidance on determining reasonable suspicion, which TSC most recently updated in February 2009, contains specific examples of the types of terrorism-related conduct that may make an individual appropriate for inclusion on the watchlist. The White House’s review of the December 25 attempted terrorist attack noted that Mr. Abdulmutallab’s father met with U.S. Embassy officers in Abuja, Nigeria, to discuss his concerns that his son may have come under the influence of unidentified extremists and had planned to travel to Yemen. However, according to NCTC, the information in the State Department’s nomination report did not meet the criteria for watchlisting in TSC’s consolidated terrorist screening database per the government’s established and approved nomination standards. NCTC also noted that the State Department cable nominating Mr. Abdulmutallab had no indication that the father was the source of the information. According to the White House review of the December 25 attempted attack, the U.S. government had sufficient information to have uncovered and potentially disrupted the attack—including by placing Mr. Abdulmutallab on the No Fly list—but analysts within the intelligence community failed to connect the dots that could have identified and warned of the specific threat. After receiving the results of the White House’s review of the December 25 attempted attack, the President called for members of the intelligence community to undertake a number of corrective actions—such as clarifying intelligence agency roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities to document, share, and analyze all sources of intelligence and threat threads related to terrorism, and accelerating information technology enhancements that will help with information correlation and analysis. The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has asked us, among other things, to assess government efforts to revise the watchlist process, including actions taken related to the December 25 attempted attack. As part of our monitoring of high-risk issues, we also have ongoing work— at the request of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs—that is assessing agency efforts to create the Information Sharing Environment, which is intended to break down barriers to sharing terrorism-related information, especially across federal agencies. Our work is designed to help ensure that federal agencies have a road map that defines roles, responsibilities, actions, and time frames for removing barriers, as well as a system to hold agencies accountable to the Congress and the public for making progress on these efforts. Among other things, this road map can be helpful in removing cultural, technological, and other barriers that lead to agencies maintaining information in stove-piped systems so that it is not easily accessible, similar to those problems that the December 25 attempted attack exposed. We expect to issue the results of this work later this year. Following the December 25 attempted terrorist attack, questions were raised as to what could have happened if Mr. Abdulmutallab had been on TSC’s consolidated terrorist screening database. We created several scenarios to help explain how the watchlist process is intended to work and what opportunities agencies could have had to identify him if he was on the watchlist. For example, according to TSC, if a record from the terrorist screening database is sent to the State Department’s system and the individual in that record holds a valid visa, TSC would compare the identifying information in the watchlist record against identifying information in the visa and forward positive matches to the State Department for possible visa revocation. If an individual’s visa is revoked, under existing procedures, this information is to be entered into the database CBP uses to screen airline passengers prior to their boarding, which we describe below. According to CBP, when the individual checks in for a flight, the on-site CBP Immigration Advisory Program officers already would have been apprised of the visa revocation by CBP and they would have checked the person’s travel documents to verify that the individual was a match to the visa revocation record. Once the positive match was established, the officers would have recommended that he not be allowed to board the flight. Under another scenario, if an individual is on TSC’s terrorist screening database, existing processes provide CBP with the opportunity to identify the subject of a watchlist record as part of the checks CBP is to conduct to see if airline passengers are eligible to be admitted into the country. Specifically, for international flights departing to or from the United States (but not for domestic flights), CBP is to receive information on passengers obtained, for example, when their travel document is swiped. CBP is to check this passenger information against a number of databases to see if there are any persons who have immigration violations, criminal histories, or any other reason for being denied entry to the country, in accordance with the agency’s mission. According to CBP, when it identifies a U.S. bound passenger who is on the watchlist, it coordinates with other federal agencies to evaluate the totality of available information to see what action is appropriate. In foreign airports where there is a CBP Immigration Advisory Program presence, the information on a watchlisted subject is forwarded by CBP to program officers onsite. The officers would then intercept the subject prior to boarding the aircraft and confirm that the individual is watchlisted, and when appropriate based on the derogatory information, request that the passenger be denied boarding. In a third scenario, if an individual is on the watchlist and is also placed on the No Fly or Selectee list, when the person checks in for a flight, the individual’s identifying information is to be checked against these lists. Individuals matched to the No Fly list are to be denied boarding. If the individual is matched to the Selectee list, the person is to be subject to further screening, which could include physical screening, such as a pat- down. The criteria in general that are used to place someone on either of these two lists include the following: Persons who are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or national security and should be precluded from boarding an aircraft are put on the No Fly list. Persons who are deemed to be a threat to civil aviation or national security but do not meet the criteria of the No Fly list are placed on the Selectee list and are to receive additional security screening prior to being permitted to board an aircraft. The White House Homeland Security Council devised these more stringent sets of criteria for the No Fly and Selectee lists in part because these lists are not intended as investigative or information-gathering tools or tracking mechanisms, and TSA is a screening but not an intelligence agency. Rather, the lists are intended to help ensure the safe transport of passengers and facilitate the flow of commerce. However, the White House’s review of the December 25 attempted terrorist attack raised questions about the effectiveness of the criteria, and the President tasked the FBI and TSC with developing recommendations for any needed changes to the nominations guidance and criteria. Weighing and responding to the potential impacts that changes to the nominations guidance and criteria could have on the traveling public and the airlines will be important considerations in developing such recommendations. In September 2006, we reported that tens of thousands of individuals who had similar names to persons on the watchlist were being misidentified and subjected to additional screening, and in some cases delayed so long as to miss their flights. We also reported that resolving these misidentifications can take time and, therefore, affect air carriers and commerce. If changes in criteria result in more individuals being added to the lists, this could also increase the number of individuals who are misidentified, exacerbating these negative effects. In addition, we explained that individuals who believe that they have been inappropriately matched to the watchlist can petition the government for action and the relevant agencies must conduct research and work to resolve these issues. If more people are misidentified, more people may trigger this redress process, increasing the need for resources. Finally, any changes to the criteria or process would have to ensure that watchlist records are used in a manner that safeguards legal rights, including freedoms, civil liberties, and information privacy guaranteed by federal law. In reacting to the December 25 attempted terrorist attack, determining whether there were potential vulnerabilities related to the use of watchlist records when screening—not only individuals who fly into the country but also, for example, those who cross land borders—are important considerations. Screening agencies whose missions most frequently and directly involve interactions with travelers generally do not check against all records in the consolidated terrorist watchlist. In our October 2007 report, we noted that this is because screening against certain records may not be needed to support a respective agency’s mission or may not be possible because of computer system limitations, among other things. For example, CBP’s mission is to determine if any traveler is eligible to enter the country or is to be denied entry because of immigration or criminal violations. As such, CBP’s computer system accepts all records from the consolidated watchlist database that have either a first name or a last name and one other identifier, such as a date of birth. Therefore, TSC sends CBP the greatest number of records from the consolidated watchlist database for its screening. In contrast, one of the State Department’s missions is to approve requests for visas. Since only non-U.S. citizens and nonlawful permanent residents apply for visas, TSC does not send the department records on citizens or lawful permanent residents for screening visa applicants. Also, the FBI database that state and local law enforcement agencies use for their missions in checking individuals for criminal histories, for example, also receives a smaller portion of the watchlist. According to the FBI, its computer system requires a full first name, last name, and other identifier, typically a date of birth. The FBI noted that this is because having these identifiers helps to reduce the number of times an individual is misidentified as being someone on the list, and the computer system would not be effective in making matches without this information. Finally, the No Fly and Selectee lists collectively contain the lowest percentage of watchlist records because the remaining ones either do not meet the nominating criteria, as described above, or do not meet system requirements—that is, include full names and dates of birth, which TSA stated are required to minimize misidentifications. TSA is implementing a new screening program that the agency states will have the capability to screen an individual against the entire watchlist. Under this program, called Secure Flight, TSA will assume from air carriers the responsibility of comparing passenger information against the No Fly and Selectee lists. According to the program’s final rule, in general, Secure Flight is to compare passenger information only to the No Fly and Selectee lists. The supplementary information accompanying the rule notes that this will be satisfactory to counter the security threat during normal security circumstances. However, the rule provides that TSA may use the larger set of watchlist records when warranted by security considerations, such as if TSA learns that flights on a particular route may pose increased risks. TSA emphasized that use of the full terrorist screening database is not routine. Rather, TSA noted that its use is limited to circumstances in which there is information concerning an increased risk to transportation security, and the decision to use the full watchlist database will be based on circumstances at the time. According to TSA, as of January 2010, the agency was developing administrative procedures for utilizing the full watchlist when warranted. In late January 2009, TSA began to assume from airlines the watchlist matching function for a limited number of domestic flights, and has since phased in additional flights and airlines. TSA expects to assume the watchlist matching function for all domestic and international flights departing to and from the United States by December 2010. It is important to note that under the Secure Flight program, TSA requires airlines to provide the agency with each passenger’s full name and date of birth to facilitate the watchlist matching process, which should reduce the number of individuals who are misidentified as the subject of a watchlist record. We continue to monitor the Secure Flight program at the Congress’s request. In our October 2007 watchlist report, we recommended that the FBI and DHS assess the extent to which security risks exist by not screening against certain watchlist records and what actions, if any, should be taken in response. The agencies generally agreed with our recommendations but noted that the risks related to not screening against all watchlist records needs to be balanced with the impact of screening against all records, especially those records without a full name and other identifiers. For example, more individuals could be misidentified, law enforcement would be put in the position of detaining more individuals until their identities could be resolved, and administrative costs could increase, without knowing what measurable increase in security is achieved. While we acknowledge these tradeoffs and potential impacts, we maintain that assessing whether vulnerabilities exist by not screening against all watchlist records—and if there are ways to limit impacts—is critical and could be a relevant component of the government’s ongoing review of the watchlist process. Therefore, we believe that our recommendation continues to have merit. As we reported in October 2007, the federal government has made progress in using the consolidated terrorist watchlist for screening purposes, but has additional opportunities to use the list. For example, DHS uses the list to screen employees in some critical infrastructure components of the private sector, including certain individuals who have access to vital areas of nuclear power plants or transport hazardous materials. However, many critical infrastructure components are not using watchlist records, and DHS has not finalized guidelines to support such private sector screening, as HSPD-6 mandated and we previously recommended. In that same report, we noted that HSPD-11 tasked the Secretary of Homeland Security with coordinating across other federal departments to develop (1) a strategy for a comprehensive and coordinated watchlisting and screening approach and (2) a prioritized implementation and investment plan that describes the scope, governance, principles, outcomes, milestones, training objectives, metrics, costs, and schedule of necessary activities. We reported that without such a strategy, the government could not provide accountability and a basis for monitoring to ensure that (1) the intended goals for, and expected results of, terrorist screening are being achieved and (2) use of the watchlist is consistent with privacy and civil liberties. We recommended that DHS develop a current interagency strategy and related plans. According to DHS’s Screening Coordination Office, during the fall of 2007, the office led an interagency effort to provide the President with an updated report, entitled, HSPD-11, An Updated Strategy for Comprehensive Terrorist-Related Screening Procedures. The office noted that the report was formally submitted to the Executive Office of the President through the Homeland Security Council and reviewed by the President on January 25, 2008. Further, the office noted that it also provided a sensitive version of the report to the Congress in October 2008. DHS provided us an excerpt of that report to review, stating that it did not have the authority to share excerpts provided by other agencies, and we were unable to obtain a copy of the full report. The information we reviewed only discussed DHS’s own efforts for coordinating watchlist screening across the department. Therefore, we were not able to determine whether the HSPD-11 report submitted to the President addressed all of the components called for in the directive or what action, if any, was taken as a result. We maintain that a comprehensive strategy, as well as related implementation and investment plans, as called for by HSPD-11, continue to be important to ensure effective governmentwide use of the watchlist process. In addition, in our October 2007 report, we noted that establishing an effective governance structure as part of this strategic approach is particularly vital since numerous agencies and components are involved in the development, maintenance, and use of the watchlist process, both within and outside of the federal government. Also, establishing a governance structure with clearly-defined responsibility and authority would help to ensure that agency efforts are coordinated, and that the federal government has the means to monitor and analyze the outcomes of such efforts and to address common problems efficiently and effectively. We determined at the time that no such structure was in place and that no existing entity clearly had the requisite authority for addressing interagency issues. We recommended that the Homeland Security Council ensure that a governance structure was in place, but the council did not comment on our recommendation. At the time of our report, TSC stated that it had a governance board in place, comprised of senior-level agency representatives from numerous departments and agencies. However, we also noted that the board provided guidance concerning issues within TSC’s mission and authority. We also stated that while this governance board could be suited to assume more of a leadership role, its authority at that time was limited to TSC- specific issues, and it would need additional authority to provide effective coordination of terrorist-related screening activities and interagency issues governmentwide. In January 2010, the FBI stated that TSC has a Policy Board in place, with representatives from relevant departments and agencies, that reviews and provides input to the government’s watchlist policy. The FBI also stated that the policies developed are then sent to the National Security Council Deputies Committee (formerly the Homeland Security Council) for ratification. The FBI noted that this process was used for making the most recent additions and changes to watchlist standards and criteria. We have not yet been able to determine, however, whether the Policy Board has the jurisdiction and authority to resolve issues beyond TSC’s purview, such as issues within the intelligence community and in regard to the nominations process, similar to the types of interagency issues the December 25 attempted attack identified. We maintain that a governance structure with the authority for and accountability over the entire watchlist process, from nominations through screening, and across the government is important. On January 7, 2010, the President tasked the National Security Staff with initiating an interagency review of the watchlist process—including the business processes, procedures, and criteria—and the interoperability and sufficiency of supporting information technology systems. This review offers the government an opportunity to develop an updated strategy, related plans, and governance structure that would provide accountability to the administration, the Congress, and the American public that the watchlist process is effective at helping to secure the homeland. As we reported in October 2009, in an effort to improve the capability to detect explosives at aviation passenger checkpoints, TSA has 10 passenger screening technologies in various phases of research, development, procurement, and deployment, including the AIT (formerly Whole Body Imager). TSA is evaluating the AIT as an improvement over current screening capabilities of the metal detector and pat-downs specifically to identify nonmetallic threat objects and liquids. The AITs produce an image of a passenger’s body that a screener interprets. The image identifies objects, or anomalies, on the outside of the physical body but does not reveal items beneath the surface of the skin, such as implants. TSA plans to procure two types of AIT units: one type uses millimeter wave and the other type uses backscatter X-ray technology. Millimeter wave technology beams millimeter wave radio frequency energy over the body’s surface at high speed from two antennas simultaneously as they rotate around the body. The energy reflected back from the body or other objects on the body is used to construct a three-dimensional image. Millimeter wave technology produces an image that resembles a fuzzy photo negative. Backscatter X-ray technology uses a low-level X-ray to create a two-sided image of the person. Backscatter technology produces an image that resembles a chalk etching. As we reported in October 2009, TSA has not yet deployed any new technologies nationwide. However, as of December 31, 2009, according to a senior TSA official, the agency has deployed 40 of the millimeter wave AITs, and has procured 150 backscatter X-ray units in fiscal year 2009 and estimates that these units will be installed at airports by the end of calendar year 2010. In addition, TSA plans to procure an additional 300 AIT units in fiscal year 2010, some of which will be purchased with funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. TSA plans to procure and deploy a total of 878 units at all category X through category IV airports. Full operating capability is expected in fiscal year 2014. TSA officials stated that the cost of the AIT is about $130,000 to $170,000 per unit, excluding installation costs. In addition, the estimated training costs are $50,000 per unit. While TSA stated that the AIT will enhance its explosives detection capability, because the AIT presents a full body image of a person during the screening process, concerns have been expressed that the image is an invasion of privacy. According to TSA, to protect passenger privacy and ensure anonymity, strict privacy safeguards are built into the procedures for use of the AIT. For example, the officer who assists the passenger never sees the image that the technology produces, and the officer who views the image is remotely located in a secure resolution room and never sees the passenger. Officers evaluating images are not permitted to take cameras, cell phones, or photo-enabled devices into the resolution room. To further protect passengers’ privacy, ways have been introduced to blur the passengers’ images. The millimeter wave technology blurs all facial features, and the backscatter X-ray technology has an algorithm applied to the entire image to protect privacy. Further, TSA has stated that the AIT’s capability to store, print, transmit, or save the image will be disabled at the factory before the machines are delivered to airports, and each image is automatically deleted from the system after it is cleared by the remotely located security officer. Once the remotely located officer determines that threat items are not present, that officer communicates wirelessly to the officer assisting the passenger. The passenger may then continue through the security process. Potential threat items are resolved through a direct physical pat-down before the passenger is cleared to enter the sterile area. In addition to privacy concerns, the AITs are large machines, and adding them to the checkpoint areas will require additional space, especially since the operators are segregated from the checkpoint to help ensure passenger privacy. We previously reported on several challenges TSA faces related to the research, development, and deployment of passenger checkpoint screening technologies and made a number of recommendations to improve this process. Two of these recommendations are particularly relevant today, as TSA moves forward with plans to install a total of 878 additional AITs—completing operational testing of technologies in airports prior to using them in day-to-day operations and assessing whether technologies such as the AIT are vulnerable to terrorist countermeasures, such as hiding threat items on various parts of the body to evade detection. First, in October 2009, we reported that TSA had relied on technologies in day-to-day airport operations that had not been proven to meet their functional requirements through operational testing and evaluation, contrary to TSA’s acquisition guidance and a knowledge-based acquisition approach. We also reported that TSA had not operationally tested the AITs at the time of our review, and we recommended that TSA operationally test and evaluate technologies prior to deploying them. In commenting on our report, TSA agreed with this recommendation. A senior TSA offici stated that although TSA does not yet have a written policy requiring operational testing prior to deployment, TSA is now including in its contracts with vendors that checkpoint screening machines are required to successfully complete laboratory tests as well as operational tests. The test results are then incorporated in the source selection plan. The official also stated that the test results are now required at key decision points by DHS’s Investment Review Board. While recently providing GAO with updated information to our October 2009 report, TSA stated that operational testing for the AIT was completed as of the end of calendar year 2009. We are in the process of verifying that TSA has tested all of the AIT’s functional requirements in an operational environment. Deploying technologies that have not successfully completed operational testing and evaluation can lead to cost overruns and underperformance. TSA’s procurement guidance provides that testing should be conducted in an operational environment to validate that the system meets all functional requirements before deployment. In addition, our reviews have shown that leading commercial firms follow a knowledge-based approach to major acquisitions and do not proceed with large investments unless the product’s design demonstrates its ability to meet functional requirements and be stable. The developer must show that the product can be manufactured within cost, schedule, and quality targets and is reliable before production begins and the system is used in day-to-day operations. TSA’s experience with the ETPs, which the agency uses for secondary screening, demonstrates the importance of testing and evaluation in an operational environment. The ETP detects traces of explosives on a passenger by using puffs of air to dislodge particles from the passenger’s body and clothing that the machine analyzes for traces of explosives. TSA procured 207 ETPs and in 2006 deployed 101 ETPs to 36 airports, the first deployment of a checkpoint technology initiated by the agency. TSA deployed the ETPs even though agency officials were aware that tests conducted during 2004 and 2005 on earlier ETP models suggested that they did not demonstrate reliable performance. Furthermore, the ETP models that were subsequently deployed were not first tested to prove their effective performance in an operational environment, contrary to TSA’s acquisition guidance, which recommends such testing. As a result, TSA procured and deployed ETPs without assurance that they would perform as intended in an operational environment. TSA officials stated that they deployed the machines without resolving these issues to respond quickly to the threat of suicide bombers. In June 2006, TSA halted further deployment of the ETP because of performance, maintenance, and installation issues. According to a senior TSA official, as of December 31, 2009, all but 9 ETPs have been withdrawn from airports and 18 ETPs remain in inventory. TSA estimates that the 9 remaining ETPs will be removed from airports by the end of calendar year 2010. In the future, using validated technologies would enhance TSA’s efforts to improve checkpoint security. Furthermore, retaining existing screening procedures until the effectiveness of future technologies has been validated could provide assurances that use of checkpoint technologies improves aviation security. Second, as we reported in October 2009, TSA does not know whether its explosives detection technologies, such as the AITs, are susceptible to terrorist tactics. Although TSA has obtained information on vulnerabilities at the screening checkpoint, the agency has not assessed vulnerabilities— that is, weaknesses in the system that terrorists could exploit in order to carry out an attack—related to passenger screening technologies, such as AITs, that are currently deployed. According to TSA’s threat assessment, terrorists have various techniques for concealing explosives on their persons, as was evident in Mr. Abdulmutallab’s attempted attack on December 25, where he concealed an explosive in his underwear. However, TSA has not assessed whether these and other tactics that terrorists could use to evade detection by screening technologies, such as AIT, increase the likelihood that the screening equipment would not detect the hidden weapons or explosives. Thus, without an assessment of the vulnerabilities of checkpoint technologies, it is unclear whether the AIT or other technologies would have been able to detect the weapon Mr. Abdulmutallab used in his attempted attack. TSA is in the process of developing a risk assessment for the airport checkpoints, but the agency has not yet completed this effort or clarified the extent to which this effort addresses any specific vulnerabilities in checkpoint technology. TSA officials stated that to identify vulnerabilities at airport checkpoints, the agency analyzes information such as the results from its covert testing program. TSA conducts national and local covert tests, whereby individuals attempt to enter the secure area of an airport through the passenger checkpoint with prohibited items in their carry-on bags or hidden on their persons. However, TSA’s covert testing programs do not systematically test passenger and baggage screening technologies nationwide to ensure that they identify the threat objects and materials the technologies are designed to detect, nor do the covert testing programs identify vulnerabilities related to these technologies. We reported in August 2008 that while TSA’s local covert testing program attempts to identify test failures that may be caused by screening equipment not working properly or caused by screeners and the screening procedures they follow, the agency’s national testing program does not attribute a specific cause of a test failure. We recommended, among other things, that TSA require the documentation of specific causes of all national covert testing failures, including documenting failures related to equipment, in the covert testing database to help TSA better identify areas for improvement. TSA concurred with this recommendation and stated that the agency will expand the covert testing database to document test failures related to screening equipment. In our 2009 report, we also recommended that the Assistant Secretary for TSA, among other actions, conduct a complete risk assessment—including threat, vulnerability, and consequence assessment—for the passenger screening program and incorporate the results into TSA’s program strategy, as appropriate. TSA and DHS concurred with our recommendation, but have not completed these risk assessments or provided documentation to show how they have addressed the concerns raised in our 2009 report regarding the susceptibility of the technology to terrorist tactics.

This statement focuses on the government's efforts to use the terrorist watchlist to screen individuals and determine if they pose a threat, and how failures in this process contributed to the December 25 attempted attack. This statement also addresses the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) planned deployment of technologies for enhanced explosive detection and the challenges associated with this deployment. GAO's comments are based on products issued from September 2006 through October 2009 and selected updates in January 2010. For these updates, GAO reviewed government reports related to the December 25 attempted attack and obtained information from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and TSA on use of the watchlist and new technologies for screening airline passengers. The intelligence community uses standards of reasonableness to evaluate individuals for nomination to the consolidated terrorist watchlist. In making these determinations, agencies are to consider information from all available sources. However, for the December 25 subject, the intelligence community did not effectively complete these steps and link available information to the subject before the incident. Therefore, agencies did not nominate the individual to the watchlist or any of the subset lists used during agency screening, such as the \"No Fly\" list. Weighing and responding to the potential impacts that changes to the nomination criteria would have on the traveling public will be an important consideration in determining what changes may be needed. Also, screening agencies stated that they do not check against all records in the watchlist, partly because screening against certain records may not be needed to support a respective agency's mission or may not be possible because of the requirements of computer programs used to check individuals against watchlist records. In October 2007, GAO reported that not checking against all records may pose a security risk and recommended that DHS and the FBI assess potential vulnerabilities, but they have not completed these assessments. TSA is implementing an advanced airline passenger prescreening program--known as Secure Flight--that could potentially result in the federal government checking passengers against the entire watchlist under certain security conditions. Further, the government lacks an up-to-date strategy and implementation plan--supported by a clearly defined leadership or governance structure--which are needed to enhance the effectiveness of terrorist-related screening and ensure accountability. In the 2007 report, GAO recommended that the Homeland Security Council ensure that a governance structure exists that has the requisite authority over the watchlist process. The council did not comment on this recommendation. As GAO reported in October 2009, since TSA's creation, 10 passenger screening technologies have been in various phases of research, development, procurement, and deployment, including the Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT)--formerly known as the Whole Body Imager. TSA expects to have installed almost 200 AITs in airports by the end of calendar year 2010 and plans to install a total of 878 units by the end of fiscal year 2014. In October 2009, GAO reported that TSA had not yet conducted an assessment of the technology's vulnerabilities to determine the extent to which a terrorist could employ tactics that would evade detection by the AIT. Thus, it is unclear whether the AIT or other technologies would have detected the weapon used in the December 25 attempted attack. GAO's report also noted the problems TSA experienced in deploying another checkpoint technology that had not been tested in the operational environment. Since GAO's October report, TSA stated that it has completed the testing as of the end of 2009. We are currently verifying that all functional requirements of the AIT were tested in an operational environment. Completing these steps should better position TSA to ensure that its costly deployment of AIT machines will enhance passenger checkpoint security.", "prediction": "The FBI noted that this process was used for making the most recent additions and changes to watchlist standards and criteria.

The Asset Forfeiture Money and Laundering Section (AFMLS) is part of DOJ’s Criminal Division and is responsible for legal aspects of the program, including civil and criminal litigation and providing legal advice to the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices. AFMLS is responsible for establishing the Asset Forfeiture Program’s policies and procedures, coordinating multidistrict asset seizures, acting on petitions for remission in judicial forfeiture cases, and coordinating international forfeiture and sharing. AFMLS also oversees the AFF’s equitable sharing program. United States Attorneys’ Offices (USAO) are responsible for the prosecution of both criminal and civil actions against property used or acquired during illegal activity. USMS serves as the primary custodian of seized property for the Asset Forfeiture Program. USMS manages and disposes of the majority of the valued property seized for forfeiture. In serving as the primary custodian of the majority of assets managed by the fund, USMS manages all valued assets that are not considered evidence, contraband, or targeted for use by individual law enforcement agencies. ATF enforces the federal laws and regulations relating to alcohol, tobacco, firearms, explosives, and arson by working directly and in cooperation with other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. While USMS is the primary custodian over valued assets, ATF maintains custody over assets seized under its authority, including firearms, ammunition, explosives, alcohol, and tobacco. DEA implements major investigative strategies against drug networks and cartels. DEA maintains custody over narcotics and other seized contraband. The FBI investigates a broad range of criminal violations, integrating the use of asset forfeiture into its overall strategy to eliminate targeted criminal enterprises. There are several agencies outside the Department of Justice that also participate in the DOJ Asset Forfeiture Program. Non-DOJ participants include the United States Postal Inspection Service, the Food and Drug Administration’s Office of Criminal Investigations, the United States Department of Agriculture’s Office of the Inspector General, the Department of State’s Bureau of Diplomatic Security, and the Department of Defense Criminal Investigative Service. There are two types of forfeiture: administrative and judicial, and they differ in a number of ways, including (1) the point in the proceeding, generally at which the property may be seized; (2) the burden of proof necessary to forfeit the property; and (3) in some cases, the type of property interests that can be forfeited. Administrative forfeiture allows for property to be forfeited without judicial involvement. Although property may be seized without any judicial involvement, seizures performed by federal agencies must be based on probable cause. In administrative forfeitures, the government initiates a forfeiture action and will take ownership of the property provided that no one steps forward to contest the forfeiture. Specifically, the administrative forfeiture procedure requires that those with an interest in the property be notified and given an opportunity to request judicial forfeiture proceedings. See below for an example of an administrative forfeiture. Example of Administrative Forfeiture DEA initiated a task force investigation into a drug-trafficking organization. Task force officers received information from a confidential source that the drug-trafficking organization was using a van with hidden compartments to transport methamphetamine and drug proceeds, and a drug detection dog gave a positive alert to the presence of drugs in the van. Officers obtained and executed a search warrant on the vehicle, which resulted in the discovery and seizure of 149 kilograms of cocaine and $1,229,785 in U.S. currency. Because no party filed a claim contesting the forfeiture, the currency was administratively forfeited by DEA pursuant to 19 U.S.C. § 1609. Judicial forfeiture, both civil and criminal, is the process by which property may be forfeited to the United States by filing a forfeiture action in federal court. In civil forfeiture, the action is against the property and thus does not require that the owner of the property be charged with a federal offense. The government must only prove a connection between the property and the crime. By contrast, criminal forfeiture requires a conviction of the defendant before property is subject to forfeiture. Example of Civil Forfeiture After obtaining a search warrant, agents searched a residence and the adjoining land on a 50-acre farm. Agents found firearms and ammunition, along with 60 pounds of processed marijuana. Agents also found approximately 4,000 marijuana plants growing outside in the adjacent field, along with approximately 2,500 plants being processed. While the owner of the farm will be subject to prosecution, because the land was used for illegal activities, a separate civil forfeiture action was filed against the property. The farm where the marijuana plants were located was seized and will be forfeited under civil forfeiture proceedings. Example of Criminal Forfeiture According to the United States Attorney, two Philadelphia-based corporations operated an Internet enterprise that facilitated interstate prostitution activities. The defendants allegedly developed and operated an Internet website and created an online network for prostitutes, escort services, and others to advertise their illegal activities to consumers and users of those services. The case was investigated by state police, FBI, and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigations Division. The investigation found that defendants received fees in the form of money orders, checks, credit card payments, and wire transfers from users of the website. The funds the defendants allegedly received were the proceeds of violations of federal laws prohibiting interstate travel in aid of racketeering enterprises, specifically prostitution, and aiding and abetting such travel. The money-laundering conspiracy charge alleges that the defendants engaged in monetary transactions in property of a value greater than $10,000 derived from those unlawful activities. The defendants entered guilty pleas to the money-laundering conspiracy charge and agreed to serve a probation term of 18 months and to pay a $1,500,000 fine. In addition, under the terms of the plea agreement, the defendants agreed to the criminal forfeiture of $4.9 million in cash derived from the unlawful activity, as well as forfeiture of the domain name, all of which represent property used to facilitate the commission of the offenses. The asset forfeiture process involves a number of key steps, including necessary planning in advance of the seizure, seizing and taking custody of the asset, notifying interested parties, addressing any claims and petitions, and equitable sharing with state and local law enforcement agencies. According to DOJ, enhancing cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies is one goal of the equitable sharing program. For more information on how agencies qualify for equitable sharing, see appendix I. From fiscal years 2003 through 2011, AFF revenues and expenditures increased, with annual revenues doubling in fiscal year 2006, due in part to an increase in forfeitures resulting from fraud and financial crimes investigations. DOJ estimates anticipated revenues and expenditures based on prior years’ trends and then carries over funds to help cover operational expenses and other liabilities in the next fiscal year, including reserves needed for pending equitable sharing and third-party payments. However, the transparency of DOJ’s process for carrying over these funds could be enhanced. Once all expenses have been accounted for and unobligated funds deemed necessary for next year’s expenses have been carried over to the next fiscal year, DOJ then reserves funds to cover annual rescissions. In the 9-year period from fiscal years 2003 through 2011, AFF revenues totaled $11 billion, growing from $500 million in fiscal year 2003 to $1.8 billion in fiscal year 2011. Since 2006, an increase in the prosecution of fraud and financial crime cases has led to substantial increases in AFF revenue.involved the misappropriation of funds by the founder of a television cable company, Adelphia Communications, and resulted in over $700 million in forfeited assets. As a result of the increase in forfeitures resulting from money laundering and financial crimes investigations, in 2006, revenues doubled those of previous years, and for the first time in the AFF’s history, total annual revenues grew above $1 billion to approximately $1.2 billion. Since 2006, the AFF’s annual revenues have remained above $1 billion, For example, a money laundering case in fiscal year 2007 with the highest revenues of $1.8 billion reported in 2011.shows the fund’s revenue growth over time from fiscal years 2003 through 2011. Moreover, according to DOJ officials, in addition to an increase in the prosecution of fraud and financial crime cases, the increase in revenues can also be attributed to an overall increase in the number of forfeiture cases together with higher-value forfeitures. Across all fiscal years, forfeited cash income constituted 76 percent or more of the AFF’s revenue sources. Forfeited cash income includes cash/currency, as well as financial instruments such as money orders, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, and shares of stock. The second, and much smaller, source of revenue is the sale of forfeited property including automobiles, boats, airplanes, jewelry, and real estate, among others. In fiscal year 2011, revenues from forfeited cash income and the sale of forfeited property together accounted for over 84 percent of the total revenues. Other sources of income may include transfers from the Treasury Forfeiture Fund (TFF), and transfers from other federal agencies. Additionally, since fiscal year 2006—when the AFF’s revenues from fraud and financial crime cases increased—large-case deposits (forfeitures greater than $25 million) of forfeited cash income have contributed an average of 37 percent to total revenues. For example, in 2007, DOJ reported a total of six large deposits that totaled $842 million, or slightly over 50 percent of the AFF’s total revenues in that fiscal year. These forfeitures of assets greater than $25 million involved investigations of misappropriation of funds, including corporate fraud and the illegal sales of pharmaceutical drugs. The types of assets that were seized in these investigations were primarily forfeited cash income. From fiscal years 2003 through 2011, AFF expenditures totaled $8.3 billion. As revenues have increased, there has been a corresponding increase in expenditures in support of asset forfeiture activities. Specifically, expenditures increased from $458 million in fiscal year 2003 to $1.3 billion in fiscal year 2011. Figure 3 shows the expenditures from fiscal year 2003 through 2011, including the large growth in expenditures beginning in 2007. Revenues resulting from forfeitures are used to pay the forfeiture program’s expenditures in three major categories: 1. payments to third parties, including payments to satisfy interested parties such as lienholders, as well as the return of funds to victims of large-scale fraud; 2. equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies that participated in law enforcement efforts resulting in the forfeitures; and 3. all other program operations expenses that include a total of 13 expenditure categories such as asset management and disposal, the storage and destruction of drugs, and investigative expenses leading to a seizure. Table 1 shows the AFF’s expenditures across all fiscal years, including payments to third parties, equitable sharing, and all other program operations expenses. Equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies have generally increased since fiscal year 2003; in fiscal year 2003, equitable sharing payments totaled $218 million, and in fiscal year 2011, equitable sharing totaled $445 million. Moreover, when compared with DOJ grant programs, equitable sharing is one of the largest DOJ programs providing funds to recipients in order to support state and local law enforcement activities. For example, in fiscal year 2010, the Victims of Crime Assistance (VOCA) Program was DOJ’s largest grant program; DOJ distributed approximately $412 million in funds through the VOCA program. By way of comparison, equitable sharing in fiscal year 2010 provided a total of $388 million in equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies. According to state and local law enforcement officials we met with, because most of their departmental budgets go toward personnel costs, the equitable sharing program is extremely important because it helps fund equipment, training, and other programs that they may otherwise not be able to afford. For example, one local law enforcement agency stated that salaries make up 96 percent of its annual budget. As a result, equitable sharing dollars allow them to purchase equipment they could not otherwise buy with the limited available annual budget. See appendix I for the total equitable sharing payments made to each state in fiscal year 2011. Equitable sharing has generally increased from 2003 through 2011; however, as a percentage of total expenditures, equitable sharing has decreased from 48 percent of total expenditures in 2003 to 34 percent in 2011. This percentage decrease began in fiscal year 2006, when another expenditure category—payments to third parties including lienholders and victims—increased from 10 to 44 percent of total expenditures. DOJ officials attribute the shift among these major expense categories in part to the increase in the prosecution of fraud cases with significant numbers of victims. Moreover, because large-case deposits are generally the result of fraud and financial crime cases, they typically have a greater proportion of payments to victims than equitable sharing, a fact that may also contribute to the overall percentage decrease in equitable sharing. For example, in fiscal year 2007, as a result of a non-prosecution agreement with Adelphia Communications, over $700 million in cash and stocks was forfeited and liquidated. In fiscal year 2012, the net proceeds from these forfeitures, which totaled approximately $728 million, were returned to victims. In addition to equitable sharing and third-party payments to victims and lienholders, the AFF is used to pay for a variety of program operations expenses. According to DOJ, the primary purpose of the AFF is to provide a stable source of resources to cover the costs of the Asset Forfeiture Program, including the costs of seizing, evaluating, inventorying, maintaining, protecting, advertising, forfeiting, and disposing of property seized for forfeiture. Among the program operations expenses covered by the AFF are costs associated with storing, maintaining, and disposing of forfeited assets. The AFF also funds case- related expenses including costs of managing paperwork, costs associated with the prosecution of forfeiture cases, costs associated with the execution of forfeiture judgments, and the costs of advertising.AFF also funds a variety of investigative expenses associated with forfeiture, including payments to reimburse any federal agency participating in the AFF for investigative costs leading to seizures. Other investigative expenses may include awards for information, purchase of evidence, and costs to fund joint task force operations. For additional details regarding expenditure categories, see appendix II. At the end of each fiscal year, DOJ carries over funds in order to help ensure it has sufficient resources to cover all AFF expenses that may not be covered by the next year’s revenues; however, the process DOJ uses to determine how much to carry over each year is not documented or outlined in its Congressional Budget Justifications. While DOJ officials stated that they cannot predict how much revenue will result from forfeitures in any given year, they attempt to estimate their anticipated revenues based on prior years’ trends. They then carry over funds needed to cover anticipated expenses for the coming year including funds needed to cover the costs of pending equitable sharing and third-party payments as well as funds needed to ensure the Asset Forfeiture Program’s solvency—including the anticipated costs associated with continuing forfeiture activities—at the start of the next fiscal year. Similar to the growth in revenues and expenditures, the funds DOJ carries over to cover these authorized expenses at the end of each fiscal year have grown since 2003. For example, at the end of fiscal year 2003, DOJ carried over approximately $365 million both to maintain solvency and to cover anticipated equitable sharing and third-party payments in fiscal year 2004. In comparison, in fiscal year 2011, DOJ carried over a total of $844 million to cover these expenditures. Additionally, DOJ officials emphasized that because revenues from fraud and financial crime cases have increased, the funds needed to make third-party payments, including payments to victims, have also increased. The flow of funds into and out of the AFF is complex and involves an interaction among revenues, expenditures, and funds carried over to manage the AFF. The following illustrates how DOJ used revenues, expenditures, and carryover funds to manage the AFF in fiscal year 2010: At the start of fiscal year 2010, DOJ carried over a total of $634 million in funds from fiscal year 2009 to maintain the program’s solvency and for pending equitable sharing and third-party payments. These funds were used at the start of fiscal year 2010 to continue operations, such as paying expenses for asset storage, and to cover pending equitable sharing and third-party payments. In addition to the $634 million, $207 million was reserved to cover DOJ’s fiscal year 2010 rescission. This rescission was proposed in the President’s budget, and later passed by Congress and enacted into law. As a result, at the start of fiscal year 2010, DOJ carried over a total of $841 million in funds from fiscal year 2009, as shown in table 2 below. In the course of fiscal year 2010, a total of approximately $1.58 billion was deposited into the AFF, including revenues received from forfeitures. Based on the total of $841 million that was carried over from fiscal year 2009 plus the $1.58 billion deposited into the AFF in fiscal year 2010, DOJ then had approximately $2.42 billion in total available resources in fiscal year 2010. Of these resources, DOJ obligated $1.45 billion in fiscal year 2010 and carried over $975 million into fiscal year 2011 to maintain solvency and reserves and to cover the proposed fiscal year 2011 rescission. While DOJ had obligated $1.45 billion for the three main expenditure categories; equitable sharing, third-party interests, and all other program operations expenses, DOJ’s actual expenditures in fiscal year 2010 totaled $1.29 billion. The difference of $0.16 billion in fiscal year 2010 represents funds that had been obligated, but had not yet been spent. According to DOJ officials, there may be a lag between the funds obligated in a fiscal year and the actual expenditures, and therefore, it is not uncommon for the total obligations to be higher than the expenditures in a given fiscal year. Table 2 shows the total funds available for use in fiscal year 2010. In order to identify the funds that will need to be carried over to cover anticipated expenses for the coming year, DOJ officials stated that they use reports generated from its asset-tracking system to identify pending equitable sharing and third-party payments. These reports provide DOJ with information to determine carry over funds needed for the disbursements that must be paid in the next fiscal year. In addition, DOJ carries over funds needed to ensure the Asset Forfeiture Program’s solvency at the start of the next fiscal year. According to DOJ officials, they consider a number of factors when calculating the funds needed to maintain solvency, such as historical data including information on the costs of past contracts, salary costs, and other expenses; known future expenses including salaries and contracts; and the costs of any potential new expenditures. DOJ officials explained the general factors they consider when carrying over funds needed to cover anticipated expenditures in the next fiscal year, but they do not specify in the AFF’s Congressional Budget Justifications how they determine the total amounts carried over each year. Specifically, the Congressional Budget Justifications do not include information on how DOJ calculated the amounts carried over nor do they explain the significant variations from one year to the next in the amount of funds carried over for solvency. For example, in fiscal year 2007, DOJ carried over $188 million based on its estimates of what it needed to cover solvency. The amount carried over to cover solvency then increased to $402 million in fiscal year 2009 and decreased to $169 million by fiscal year 2011. Figure 4 shows the variation in carryover funds retained in the AFF at the end of each fiscal year to cover solvency, equitable sharing, and third-party payments from fiscal years 2003 through 2011. DOJ officials stated that a number of cost drivers may change the funds needed for solvency from year to year. These cost drivers include salaries for government employees, information systems costs, asset management and disposal contracts, and contracts for administrative support staff, among other things. According to DOJ, these categories comprise recurring operational costs of the Asset Forfeiture Program. While these expenses are generally funded by AFF revenues, DOJ carries over funds to ensure it has sufficient resources that may not be covered by the next year’s revenues. Moreover, additional funds may need to be carried over to account for any number of program uncertainties. For example, the AFF could be responsible for making payments related to pending judicial actions, in the event that DOJ were to lose a forfeiture case in court. Therefore, DOJ may carry over more funds from one fiscal year to the next in order to cover these types of liabilities. DOJ officials stated that they estimate needed carryover funds by reviewing the cost drivers, as well as by assessing the risk that revenues may be less than projected. DOJ officials further noted that planning for AFF carryover and the actual carryover can differ due to the unpredictable dynamics of the fund. According to DOJ officials, there is no documented process used to determine the amount of funds that are carried over at the end of each fiscal year. Our prior work has emphasized the importance of transparency in federal agencies’ budget presentations to help provide Congress the necessary The information to make appropriation decisions and conduct oversight. department provides a yearly budget justification to Congress that details the estimated revenues, expenses, and carryover requirements for the upcoming fiscal year as well as AFF-related performance information. Officials further noted that the Congressional Justification includes discussions of the various categories of fund expenses, but does not include a detailed discussion of the process used to estimate the amounts carried over. Without a clearly documented and transparent process that demonstrates how DOJ determines the amounts that will be carried over each year, it is difficult to determine whether DOJ’s conclusions regarding the amounts that need to be carried over each year are well founded. Providing more transparent information as part of the AFF’s annual budget process would better inform Congress’ oversight of the AFF, by making it easier to evaluate whether the funds carried over to maintain Asset Forfeiture Program solvency and cover pending equitable sharing and third-party payments adequately reflect the AFF’s needed resources. After revenues needed to cover expenses in the current and upcoming fiscal years have been carried over, DOJ reserves funds to cover rescissions. After these funds have been reserved, any funds determined to be in excess of these requirements (excess unobligated balances) may be declared as Super Surplus. While these Super Surplus balances may be used at DOJ’s discretion for a variety of purposes, in recent years, these balances have been used as a means to supplement the funds reserved to cover yearly rescissions proposed in the President’s budget, and later passed by Congress and enacted into law. Figure 5 provides a description of the process for identifying Super Surplus balances in any given fiscal year. Rescissions are legislative actions to reduce an agency’s budgetary resources. For example, in fiscal year 2010, $387 million was rescinded from the AFF, and in fiscal year 2011, the enacted rescission totaled $495 million. Rescinded funds are generally taken from an agency and returned to the Treasury before they are obligated. However, per Office of Management and Budget (OMB) guidance, rescinded funds from the AFF have not been returned to the Treasury. Instead, DOJ has treated the funds as unavailable for obligation for the remainder of the fiscal year for which the rescission was enacted. At the beginning of each new fiscal year, DOJ would have made the rescinded funds available for obligation again, also in response to OMB guidance, had a new rescission not been enacted. With the enactment of a new rescission for the subsequent fiscal year, however, DOJ has continued to treat the rescinded funds as unavailable for obligation. For example, the $387 million that was rescinded from the AFF in fiscal year 2010 was treated as unavailable for obligation in fiscal year 2010, and was then used again to cover part of the enacted $495 million rescission in fiscal year 2011. To make up the difference needed to meet the $495 million rescission in fiscal year 2011, DOJ used unobligated balances in the amount of $233 million. Table 3 shows the enacted rescissions for each fiscal year, as well as the unobligated balances used by DOJ in order to meet the rescissions. One effect of these rescissions is to reduce the department’s discretionary spending in the year in which the rescission was enacted. This could ultimately decrease the size of the federal deficit, provided the decreased spending from the rescission is not offset by increased spending elsewhere. For example, in fiscal year 2012, DOJ’s discretionary budget authority was reduced to $27.4 billion, due in part to the $675 million enacted AFF rescission. DOJ has established guidelines and oversight mechanisms for the equitable sharing program, but additional controls could enhance the consistency and transparency of the program. Moreover, DOJ has recently started conducting reviews of state and local law enforcement agencies that participate in the equitable sharing program to determine the extent to which they are complying with program policies as well as bookkeeping, accounting, and reporting requirements. DOJ has established written guidelines governing how state and local law enforcement agencies should apply for equitable sharing. Specifically, according to the guidelines, state and local law enforcement agencies must submit an application for equitable sharing in which they outline identifying information for their agency, information on the asset that was forfeited, how they intend to use the asset (or the proceeds of the asset), and the number of work hours their agency contributed to the investigation. In addition, DOJ has established mechanisms governing how DOJ agencies should make equitable sharing determinations. Specifically, the field office for the DOJ agency that served as the lead federal agency in the investigation is responsible for making an initial recommendation regarding the percentage of the proceeds of the forfeited asset that each participating agency should receive. According to forfeiture statutes governing the transfer of forfeited property to state and local law enforcement agencies, equitable sharing determinations must bear a reasonable relationship to the degree of direct participation of the requesting agency in the total law enforcement effort leading to the forfeiture. are to be based on a comparison of the work hours that each federal, state, and local law enforcement agency contributed to the investigation. However, according to DOJ guidelines, further adjustments to sharing percentages may be made when work hours alone do not reflect the relative value of an agency’s participation in an investigation. For example, if a state or local law enforcement agency contributed additional resources or equipment to an investigation, its sharing percentage might be adjusted upward from what it would be based on work hours alone. See 21 U.S.C. §881(e)(3); 18 U.S.C. §981(e). of the agencies that participated in the investigation.then required to forward both the application forms completed by state and local law enforcement agencies and sharing recommendations to investigative agency headquarters officials for review. The review process differs depending on the amount and type of the forfeiture, as follows: For administrative forfeitures less than $1 million, agency headquarters officials are responsible for reviewing and approving the final sharing determination. For judicial forfeitures less than $1 million, agency headquarters officials are to forward the recommendation to the USAO for final approval. In any administrative or judicial forfeiture where the total appraised value of all forfeited assets is $1 million or more, in multidistrict cases, and in cases involving the equitable transfer of real property, the agency headquarters officials forward the recommendation to the USAO for review, which is then submitted to AFMLS officials for review. o Where the investigative agency, the USAO, and AFMLS concur in a sharing recommendation, the Assistant Attorney General makes the final equitable sharing determination. o Where the investigative agency, the USAO, and AFMLS do not all concur in a sharing recommendation, the Deputy Attorney General (DAG) determines the appropriate share. Figure 6 shows the steps involved in making equitable sharing determinations. While DOJ has established guidance indicating that adjustments to sharing percentages may be made when a state or local law enforcement agency’s work hours alone do not reflect the value of its participation in an investigation, DOJ has not developed guidance regarding how to apply the qualitative factors that may warrant departures from sharing percentages. DOJ agencies currently make adjustments to sharing percentages based on a number of qualitative factors regarding the additional assistance or contributions state or local law enforcement agencies may have made during an investigation. According to DOJ’s written guidelines, DOJ agencies must take these factors into account when determining whether to adjust an equitable sharing percentage beyond a strict work hour allocation. For example, according to DOJ guidelines, the deciding authority should consider such factors as the inherent importance of the activity, the length of the investigation, whether an agency originated the information leading to the seizure, or whether an agency provided unique and indispensable assistance, among others. In addition, DOJ’s Equitable Sharing Guidelines state that each agency may use judgment when determining how these qualitative factors should be used to adjust sharing percentages. In the course of our review, DOJ officials provided examples of these qualitative factors. For example, if a state or local law enforcement agency provided a helicopter, drug-sniffing dog, or a criminal informant to an investigation, DOJ would consider these contributions to be unique or indispensible assistance. In one case we reviewed, a local law enforcement agency that participated in a joint investigation with federal agents would have received 7.4 percent in equitable sharing based on the work hours it contributed to the investigation. However, the agency also provided information obtained from a confidential source that led to the seizure and provided a helicopter for aerial surveillance. As a result, its final sharing determination was adjusted upward from 7.4 percent to 12 percent. If the net proceeds of the forfeiture are $1.6 million once all investigative and forfeiture-related expenses have been paid, the resulting equitable sharing payment made to the law enforcement agency will increase from $118,400 to $192,000. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government calls for significant events to be clearly documented in directives, policies, or manuals to help ensure operations are carried out as intended. AFMLS officials report that they have established “rules of thumb” based on historical knowledge or precedent when applying these qualitative factors to equitable sharing adjustments that are subject to their review, but have not issued guidance to the DOJ agencies. Further, headquarters officials for each of the DOJ agencies emphasized that they follow the guidelines issued by DOJ when making adjustments to sharing percentages. However, as previously discussed, these guidelines outline the qualitative factors that may be considered when making adjustments to sharing percentages, but they do not include any additional information regarding how qualitative factors should be used to adjust sharing percentages. As a result, agency headquarters officials stated that field office staff use their own judgment when determining how qualitative factors should be used to adjust sharing percentages. AFMLS officials state that adjustments to equitable sharing percentages based on qualitative factors should be made on a case-by-case basis because each investigation is unique and the facts and circumstances of each case must be considered in totality before making adjustments to sharing determinations. While we recognize the inherently subjective nature of evaluating each agency’s unique contributions to a case based on facts and circumstances, additional guidance regarding how to apply the qualitative factors could help to improve transparency and better ensure consistency with which these qualitative factors are applied over time or across cases. This is particularly important given that these determinations represent DOJ’s overall assessment of each agency’s unique contributions to an investigation and are a key component of how DOJ makes decisions about how much to award each agency. DOJ’s written guidance also requires the DOJ agencies that are responsible for making equitable sharing determinations to use work hours as the primary basis for calculating sharing percentages; however, agencies do not consistently document the work hours each agency contributed to the investigation. According to DOJ officials, the work hours contributed by each of the local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation should be added together by the DOJ agency leading the investigation to arrive at a total. Each law enforcement agency’s individual work hours are then divided by the total in order to determine each agency’s equitable sharing percentage. DOJ’s guidance states that every agency participating in the investigation should report work hours on either the application for equitable sharing or on the equitable sharing decision form. While state and local law enforcement agencies record their work hours on their applications for equitable sharing, we found that the DOJ agencies did not consistently record their own hours or the total hours contributed by all participating agencies. Of the 25 equitable sharing determinations we reviewed, 5 included supplemental memos provided by the DOJ agencies detailing the work hours provided by all of the agencies involved in the investigation. However, these memos are not required under existing DOJ guidance and were provided in only those investigations subject to AFMLS review. For the remaining 20 determinations, DOJ agencies did not document this information. Specifically, although work hours serve as the primary basis of calculating equitable sharing determinations, in 20 of the 25 determinations we reviewed, neither the work hours contributed by DOJ agencies nor the total number of work hours contributed by all of the agencies involved in the investigation were recorded in the documents provided to agency headquarters officials for review. According to DOJ agency headquarters officials responsible for reviewing and approving equitable sharing determinations, they rely on agents in the field to calculate sharing percentages and as a result, they do not verify the work hours contributed by each agency involved in the investigation. In the absence of documented work hours, it is unclear how deciding authorities could verify whether equitable sharing determinations involving millions of dollars in assets were calculated in accordance with established guidance. DOJ’s guidance does not explicitly require DOJ agencies to record the rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages when work hours alone do not reflect the value of an agency’s participation in the investigation. In the 25 equitable sharing determinations we reviewed, state and local law enforcement agencies often reported basic information regarding their agency’s role in a particular investigation in their applications for equitable sharing, but DOJ’s rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages was not consistently documented in each investigation. Specifically, agencies did not consistently document whether they believed the state or local law enforcement agency made additional contributions that warranted departures from standard sharing percentages. Of the 25 determinations we reviewed, 5 included supplemental memos provided by the DOJ agencies indicating whether adjustments from standard sharing percentages were warranted. In 3 of these 5 AFMLS determinations, adjustments to sharing percentages were made based on the additional contributions of the state and local law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation and the memos detailed the rationale for making the adjustment in each case. However, these memos are not required under existing DOJ guidance and were provided in only those investigations subject to AFMLS review. For the remaining 20 investigations, DOJ did not document this information. Moreover, because work hours were not documented in these cases, it was not possible to determine whether further adjustments were made based on additional contributions made by each of the agencies involved in the investigation. According to DOJ agency headquarters officials responsible for reviewing and approving equitable sharing determinations, they rely on agents in the field to calculate sharing percentages and, as a result, they do not attempt to verify the adjustments that are made based on each agency’s additional contributions to the investigation. Specifically, agency headquarters officials reported that the field is responsible for confirming state and local law enforcement’s contributions to a case through a variety of means including face-to-face meetings, telephone conversations, and e-mails. For example, one agency official noted that although the rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages is not included in the documents provided to headquarters for review and approval, the field office is most familiar with the investigation and the contributions that each state and local law enforcement agency may have made in a given case. Therefore, headquarters considers the field office to be the best source of information for how qualitative factors should be taken into account when adjusting sharing percentages. Agency headquarters officials further noted that it is rare for them to question equitable sharing recommendations made by the field or to ask for more information regarding the rationale for adjustments to sharing percentages. While the field office may have firsthand knowledge of the contributions of state and local law enforcement agencies in a given investigation, in the absence of the rationale for adjustments to sharing percentages being documented, there is limited transparency over how and why agencies make adjustments to sharing determinations when work hours alone do not accurately represent an agency’s contribution to an investigation. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that transactions should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value to management in controlling operations and making decisions. This applies to the entire process or life cycle of a transaction or event from the initiation and authorization through its final classification in summary records. In addition, control activities help to ensure that all transactions are completely and accurately recorded. In the absence of consistently documenting work hours and the rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages, it is unclear how the equitable sharing deciding authorities could evaluate the nature and value of the contributions of each of the agencies involved in the investigation. Establishing a mechanism to ensure that this information is documented by all DOJ agencies responsible for making equitable sharing determinations could enhance the transparency of equitable sharing decisions. In the absence of documenting work hours or the rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages, deciding authorities have limited means to verify the basis for equitable sharing decisions. Agency headquarters officials responsible for reviewing and approving equitable sharing determinations report that they review equitable sharing applications and decision forms to ensure that they are complete and that sharing determinations appear reasonable. However, headquarters officials for each of the DOJ agencies reported that they rely on field office staff to ensure that equitable sharing percentages were calculated correctly based on the work hours and the qualitative factors that each federal, state, and local law enforcement agency contributed to the investigation. However, because the information that serves as the basis for equitable sharing recommendations—including work hours and the qualitative factors used to make adjustments to sharing percentages—are not subject to review by agency headquarters officials, DOJ does not have reasonable assurance that the equitable sharing determinations are made in accordance with the established guidance. According to Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, controls should generally be designed to ensure that ongoing monitoring occurs in the course of normal operations. Such monitoring should be performed continually and ingrained in the agency’s operations. This could include regular management and supervisory activities, comparisons, reconciliations, or other actions. Developing a mechanism to verify the work hours and qualitative factors that serve as the basis for equitable sharing determinations could improve DOJ’s visibility over equitable sharing determinations and help promote confidence in the integrity of the equitable sharing program. Agency headquarters officials have reported that altogether, DEA, ATF, and FBI reviewed a total of 52,034 equitable sharing requests in fiscal year 2011, and 113 of these requests went to AFMLS for review and approval. As a result, agency headquarters officials note that they have limited resources to verify the basis for each and every equitable sharing determination. We recognize that in the face of these limited resources, it may not be practical for agency headquarters officials to review all of the information used in support of all equitable sharing determinations. However, a spot check approach would allow headquarters officials to assess the extent to which equitable sharing decisions are made in accordance with established guidelines to help address resource constraints. DOJ has established requirements governing the permissible uses of equitable sharing funds. Specifically, DOJ’s guidelines state that equitably shared funds or assets put into official use shall be used by law enforcement agencies for law enforcement purposes only. Some of the permissible uses of equitable sharing funds include training, facilities, equipment, travel and transportation in support of law enforcement activities, as well as paying for the costs of asset accounting and auditing functions. Examples of impermissible uses of equitable sharing funds include payments to cover the costs of salaries or benefits and non-law enforcement education and training. DOJ’s guidelines also state that agencies should use federal sharing monies prudently and in such a manner as to avoid any appearance of extravagance, waste, or impropriety. For example, tickets to social events, hospitality suites at conferences, or meals outside of the per diem are all considered impermissible uses of shared funds. DOJ’s guidelines further state that equitable sharing funds must be used to increase or supplement the resources of the receiving state or local law enforcement agency and should not be used to replace or supplant the appropriated resources of the recipient. This means that equitable sharing funds must serve only to supplement funds they would normally receive and must not be used as a substitute for funds or equipment that would otherwise be provided by the law enforcement agency. For example, if city officials were to cut the police department’s budget by $100,000 as a result of the police department’s receiving $100,000 in equitable sharing funds, DOJ would consider this to be an example of improper supplantation, which is not an allowable use of equitable sharing funds. In addition to establishing requirements governing the permissible uses of equitably shared funds and property, DOJ has also established bookkeeping, internal controls, reporting, and audit requirements that state and local law enforcement agencies must follow in order to participate in the equitable sharing program. For example, state and local law enforcement agencies must establish mechanisms to track equitably shared funds and property, implement proper bookkeeping and accounting procedures, maintain compliance with internal controls standards, and meet defined reporting standards. Among other things, DOJ’s equitable sharing guidance calls for participating agencies to avoid commingling DOJ equitable sharing funds with funds from any other source, maintain a record of all equitable sharing expenditures, and complete annual reports known as Equitable Sharing Agreement and Certification Forms. These Equitable Sharing Agreement and Certification Forms require agencies participating in the equitable sharing program to report annually on the actual amounts and uses of equitably shared funds and property. Among other things, agencies must detail the beginning and ending equitable sharing fund balance, and the totals spent on specific law enforcement activities (e.g., training, computers, weapons, and surveillance equipment). In submitting the form each year, agencies must certify that they will be complying with the guidelines and statutes governing the equitable sharing program. Office of Management and Budget, “Audits of States, Local Governments and Non-Profit Organizations,” A-133, June 27, 2003. requirements, the substantial majority of equitable sharing participants are required to comply with the Single Audit Act. Under a Single Audit, an auditor must provide his or her opinion on the presentation of the entity’s financial statements and schedule of federal expenditures, and on compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and provisions of contracts or grant agreements that could have a direct and material effect on the financial statements. AFMLS officials reported that pilot testing of the compliance review process was started in December 2010, but the compliance review team did not start on a full-scale basis until April 2011. beforehand either through news reports or referrals from the U.S. Attorneys’ Offices. AFMLS has established guidelines for conducting compliance reviews of equitable sharing participants in order to determine the extent to which agencies are following established equitable sharing guidelines. Among other things, they select a sample of the agency’s expenditures in order to substantiate the agency’s records and to confirm that the expenditure was consistent with established DOJ guidelines. AFMLS also determines whether the agency has established an appropriate system of internal controls for tracking and recording equitable sharing receipts and expenditures. Further, AFMLS determines whether the agency was subject to Single Audit requirements and if so, whether the Single Audit including reporting on equitable sharing funds was completed as required. As of December 2011, AFMLS had completed a total of 11 onsite audits of approximately 9,200 state and local law enforcement agencies that participate in the equitable sharing program.has limited staff (eight total) and resources to conduct compliance reviews of equitable sharing participants. As a result, AFMLS reported conducting risk assessments in order to select agencies for compliance reviews. In addition to monitoring news briefs regarding the potential misuse of funds among equitable sharing participants, some of the issues that AFMLS considers as part of these risk assessments include the amount of each agency’s equitable sharing expenditures, whether a state or local law enforcement agency has reported spending a significant amount of money in a sensitive area, and whether a small law enforcement agency that may be unfamiliar with the equitable sharing program suddenly received a large equitable sharing payment. The 11 compliance reviews completed in 2011 revealed that participants do not consistently follow requirements to properly account for equitable sharing receipts and expenditures, do not consistently comply with the allowable AFMLS reports it currently uses of equitable sharing funds, and do not consistently complete Single Audits as required. AFMLS identified one or more areas for corrective action in 9 of the 11 compliance reviews. Two of the state and local law enforcement agencies were determined to be in full compliance with all of the equitable sharing requirements. In May 2012, AFMLS officials reported that all of the agencies had fully addressed the corrective actions identified by AFMLS. See appendix III for the results of the 11 compliance reviews AFMLS has completed as of December 2011. AFMLS has established a mechanism to systematically track and analyze the results of these reviews. Specifically, the findings from each compliance review are entered into a tracking report, and follow-up with each agency is completed to ensure that corrective actions are taken. AFMLS officials noted that they may follow up with an agency multiple times to ensure that items identified for corrective action are addressed. According to AFMLS, tracking frequencies and trends identified in the course of compliance reviews is an important tool in risk evaluations for both future audit selections and return audits to specific participants with particularly troublesome problems. Further, AFMLS officials have stated that they plan to use the results of compliance reviews in order to identify larger trends that may need to be addressed across all equitable sharing participants. For example, AFMLS has found through these reviews that equitable sharing recipients are not consistently reporting equitable sharing expenditures on Single Audits. AFMLS has reported that it is currently working with both equitable sharing recipients and the auditor community to address this issue. AFMLS’s approach to conducting compliance reviews of equitable sharing participants is consistent with standards for internal control, which state that monitoring should assess the quality of performance over time and ensure that the findings of audits and other reviews are promptly resolved. With more than $1 billion in forfeited assets deposited into the AFF every year since 2006, the Asset Forfeiture Program generates substantial revenue for the Department of Justice. These funds are used to cover annual operating expenses, to compensate crime victims, or are shared with state and local law enforcement agencies that participate in investigations resulting in forfeiture. The significant amounts of money involved as well as the sensitive nature of asset forfeiture mean it is imperative to be vigilant in maintaining the transparency of the program. Since the Asset Forfeiture Program’s operations are supported by annual revenues, DOJ faces a challenging task estimating future revenues and expenditures each year. The AFF’s annual revenues have consistently exceeded annual expenditures, allowing DOJ to cover annual rescissions and to reserve funds for the next fiscal year. This allows DOJ to ensure that the AFF has sufficient resources at the start of each fiscal year to cover solvency and pending equitable sharing and third-party payments. However, the AFF’s Congressional Budget Justification does not clearly outline the factors that DOJ considers when determining the total amounts that need to be carried over each fiscal year. As part of the AFF’s annual budget process, documenting how DOJ determines the funds that need to be carried over at the end of each year and providing additional details on that determination to Congress would provide more transparency over the process and would help Congress make more informed appropriations decisions. In addition, the authorization to share federal forfeiture proceeds with cooperating state and local law enforcement agencies is one of the most important provisions of asset forfeiture. DOJ has established guidelines stating that adjustments to equitable sharing percentages should be based on qualitative factors; however, additional guidance regarding how to apply these factors could help to improve the transparency and better ensure consistency with which adjustments to sharing percentages are made over time or across cases. Additionally, there are gaps in the extent to which key information that serves as the basis for equitable sharing decisions is documented. In the absence of documenting the work hours used to calculate initial equitable sharing percentages—the primary means to determine each agency’s share of forfeiture proceeds—it is unclear how equitable sharing deciding authorities could verify the relative degree of participation of each of the agencies involved in the case. Similarly, documenting information on DOJ’s rationale for making adjustments to sharing percentages could help to improve transparency over whether equitable sharing decisions are being made in accordance with DOJ’s guidance. Additionally, establishing a mechanism to verify that equitable sharing determinations are made in accordance with established guidance would provide DOJ with greater assurance that there are effective management practices in place to help promote confidence in the integrity of the equitable sharing program. We are making four recommendations to the Attorney General. To help improve transparency over the AFF’s use of funds, we recommend that the Attorney General provide more detailed information to Congress as part of the AFF’s annual budget process, clearly documenting how DOJ determines the amount of funds to be carried over into the next fiscal year. To help improve management controls over the equitable sharing program, we recommend that the Attorney General direct AFMLS to take the following three actions: Develop and implement additional guidance on how DOJ agencies should apply qualitative factors when making adjustments to equitable sharing percentages. Establish a mechanism to ensure that the basis for equitable sharing determinations—including the work hours contributed by all participating agencies and the rationale for any adjustments to sharing percentages—are recorded in the documents provided to agency headquarters officials for review and approval. Develop a risk-based mechanism to monitor whether key information in support of equitable sharing determinations is recorded and the extent to which sharing determinations are made in accordance with established guidance. We provided a draft of this report to DOJ for its review and comment. DOJ did not provide official written comments to include in our report. However, in an e-mail received on June 21, 2012, the DOJ liaison stated that the department appreciated the opportunity to review the draft report and that DOJ concurred with our recommendations. DOJ further noted that the department will develop a plan of corrective action in order to address the recommendations. DOJ also provided us written technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to the Attorney General, selected congressional committees, and other interested parties. In addition, this report is also available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov.

Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. Key contributors to this report are listed in appendix IV. State and local law enforcement agencies typically qualify for equitable sharing by participating directly with Department of Justice (DOJ) agencies in joint investigations leading to the seizure and forfeiture of property. Agencies may either receive a portion of the proceeds resulting from the sale of the forfeited asset or may request that a forfeited asset such as a vehicle be put into official use. Any property other than contraband or firearms may be transferred to a state or local agency for official use provided that it is used for law enforcement purposes. State and local law enforcement can receive equitable sharing payments after working on a joint case with one or more federal law enforcement partners or after participating in a case carried out by a federal law enforcement task force. Approximately 83 percent of all equitable sharing determinations are the result of joint investigations. State and local law enforcement agencies can also qualify for equitable sharing by requesting that federal partners adopt a case initiated at the state or local level. An adoptive forfeiture occurs when local police officials effectively hand a case over to federal law enforcement officials provided that the property in question is forfeitable under federal law. According to DOJ officials, many state and local law enforcement agencies will make seizures pursuant to their state laws. However, they may reach out to federal law enforcement agencies to adopt a forfeiture if they don’t have a state or local statute that allows them to carry out a forfeiture. For example, in a particular case, there may be large amounts of cash involved but no drugs found or seized. Federal statute allows for the forfeiture of assets based on illegal activity even if there are no drugs seized, whereas the state or local statute might not allow for this type of forfeiture. Alternatively, state and local law enforcement agencies may request that DOJ adopt a forfeiture in those cases where federal coordination or expertise is needed in the case. Our analysis shows a slight decrease in adoptive versus non-adoptive equitable sharing payments since 2003. In 2003, adoptions made up about 23 percent of all equitable sharing payments, while in 2010, adoptions made up about 17 percent of all equitable sharing payments. According to DOJ, as more states have established their own forfeiture laws, they may rely less on DOJ to adopt forfeiture cases and may instead pursue forfeitures under state law when appropriate. Figure 7 shows the equitable sharing payments made to each state in fiscal year 2011. Directions: Place mouse over each state name for the total equitable sharing payments made to that state in fiscal year 2011. Ill. Our analysis shows a strong positive association between the equitable sharing payments made to each state and the state’s total population. However, our analysis found no correlation between per capita equitable sharing payments and arrest rates, once we corrected for population size. It is important to note that a number of other factors may influence the amount of equitable sharing payments a state receives in a given year. For example, if a state or local law enforcement agency participated in a joint investigation that resulted in a very large forfeiture, the agency might receive a significant amount of equitable sharing dollars, even if no arrests were made in conjunction with the case. Alternately, an agency may work several cases that generate multiple arrests, but no forfeitures, so no equitable sharing payments would be made. Finally, differences in equitable sharing between states may be influenced by whether state and local law enforcement agencies decide to pursue forfeitures under their state laws versus those cases where federal involvement may be warranted. 1. Third-Party Payments: Third-party payments are payments to satisfy third-party interests, including lienholders and other innocent parties, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 524(c)(1)(D); payments in connection with the remission and mitigation of forfeitures, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 524(c)(1)(E). 2. Equitable Sharing Payments: These funds are reserved until the receipt of the final forfeiture orders that result in distributions to the participants. Equitable sharing payments represent the transfer of portions of federally forfeited cash and proceeds from the sale of forfeited property to state and local law enforcement agencies and foreign governments that directly assisted in targeting or seizing the property. Most task force cases, for example, result in property forfeitures whose proceeds are shared among the participating agencies. All other program operations expenses 3. Asset Management and Disposal: According to DOJ, the primary purpose of the Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) is to ensure an adequate and appropriate source of funding for the management and disposal of forfeited assets. Also, funding is required for the assessment, containment, removal, and destruction of hazardous materials seized for forfeiture, and hazardous waste contaminated property seized for forfeiture. The United States Marshals Service (USMS) has primary responsibility for the storage and maintenance of assets, while the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) are responsible for the disposal of toxic and hazardous substances. 4. Case-Related Expenses: Case-related expenses are expenses associated with the prosecution of a forfeiture case or execution of a forfeiture judgment, such as advertising, travel and subsistence, court and deposition reporting, courtroom exhibit services, and expert witness costs. In appropriate cases, the services of foreign counsel may be necessary. 5. Special Contract Services: The AFF uses contract personnel to manage the paperwork associated with forfeiture, including data entry, data analysis, word processing, file control, file review, quality control, case file preparation, and other process support functions. 6. Investigative Expenses Leading to Seizure: Investigative expenses are those normally incurred in the identification, location, and seizure of property subject to forfeiture. These include payments to reimburse any federal agency participating in the AFF for investigative costs leading to seizures. 7. Contracts to Identify Assets: Investigative agencies use these funds for subscription services to nationwide public record data systems, and for acquisition of specialized assistance, such as reconstruction of seized financial records. According to DOJ, these resources are used to identify assets during the investigative stage of the case, where such research will enhance effective use of the asset forfeiture sanction. DOJ officials note that if the government can improve upon the identification of ill-gotten assets, the nature of the criminal wrongdoing can be better demonstrated and reinforced before the jury. Such evidence results in greater penalties for criminals who may have avoided such penalties in the past by successfully concealing such assets. 8. Awards for Information Leading to a Forfeiture: The Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act, 1997, amended the Justice Fund statute to treat payments of awards based on the amount of the forfeiture the same as other costs of forfeiture. Therefore, the amount available each year for expenses for awards no longer had to be specified in annual appropriations acts. 9. Automated Data Processing: Recurring costs include telecommunications support, system and equipment maintenance, user support and help desk, software maintenance, user training, equipment, and data center charges in support of the Consolidated Asset Tracking System (CATS). All asset forfeiture activity for each asset is recorded in CATS. According to DOJ, CATS enables access for more than 1,000 locations to a central database to perform full asset forfeiture life-cycle tasks more efficiently. The system provides current information to field personnel on the status of cases, integrates financial analysis capabilities into the inventory management process, provides the estimation of program income and expenses, and provides the capability for agency and department managers to review and assess program activity. 10. Training and Printing: This category funds expenses for training personnel on aspects of the federal forfeiture program as well as other training necessary to maintain the competency of federal and contractor personnel dedicated to performing federal forfeiture functions. Printing costs reflect the continuing need to provide current legal advice and support. Expenses include updating and distributing manuals and pamphlets directly related to forfeiture issues, policies, and procedures. 11. Other Program Management: This category includes several types of expenses in support of the overall management of the Asset Forfeiture Program, including management analysis, performance assessment, problem analysis, requirements analyses, policy development, and other special projects designed to improve program performance. This funding is to provide travel and per diem funds for temporary duty assignments needed to correct program deficiencies. Other activities funded under this heading include the annual audit of the financial statements of the Assets Forfeiture Fund and the Seized Asset Deposit Fund by an independent accounting firm and special assessments and reviews. This category also finances the Asset Forfeiture Money Laundering Section (AFMLS), Asset Forfeiture Management Staff (AFMS), and, since 2001, USMS headquarters administrative personnel and non- personnel costs associated with the forfeiture program. In addition, the AFF funds Deputy U.S. Marshal salaries to enhance the legal and fiduciary responsibilities that are inherent in the seizure of personal and real property during the pendency of a forfeiture action. 12. Storage, Protection, and Destruction of Controlled Substances: These expenses are incurred to store, protect, or destroy controlled substances. 13. Joint Federal, State, and Local Law Enforcement Operations: Under 28 U.S.C. § 524(c)(1)(l), the AFF has authority to pay for “overtime, travel, fuel, training, equipment, and other similar costs of state or local law enforcement officers that are incurred in a joint law enforcement operation with a federal law enforcement agency participating in the Fund.” 14. Awards for Information and Purchase of Evidence Awards payable from the AFF directly support law enforcement efforts by encouraging the cooperation and assistance of informants. The AFF may also be used to purchase evidence of violations of drug laws, Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO), and criminal money laundering laws. According to DOJ, payment of awards to sources of information creates motivation for individuals to assist the government in the investigation of criminal activity and the seizure of assets. 15. Equipping of Conveyances: This category provides funding to equip vehicles, vessels, or aircraft for law enforcement functions, but not to acquire them. Purchased equipment must be affixed to and used integrally with the conveyance. This funding is used for emergency and communications equipment, voice privacy and surveillance equipment, armoring, and engine upgrades and avionic equipment for aircraft. According to DOJ, it is only through AFF resources that many of these surveillance vehicles are available to the field districts that need them. DEA uses various surveillance techniques, including stationary and mobile platforms to conduct surveillance and gather intelligence, the cornerstone of cases against most major drug violators. In addition, evidence obtained through the use of such surveillance often provides the audio and video documentation necessary for conviction. DOJ’s Asset Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section completed a total of 11 compliance reviews of equitable sharing participants in 2011. Table 4 shows the results of the 11 compliance reviews. In addition to the contact named above, Sandra Burrell and Dawn Locke (Assistant Directors), Sylvia Bascope, Samantha Carter, Raymond Griffith, Mike Harmond, Shirley Hwang, Valerie Kasindi, and Jeremy Manion made key contributions to the report. Also contributing to this report were Lydia Araya, Benjamin Bolitzer, Frances Cook, Katherine Davis, Richard Eiserman, Janet Temko, Mitchell Karpman, Linda Miller, Jan Montgomery, Bintou Njie, Robert Lowthian, Cynthia Saunders, and Jerry Seigler.", "reference": "Every year, federal law enforcement agencies seize millions of dollars in assets in the course of investigations. The AFF was established to receive the proceeds of forfeiture and holds more than $1 billion in assets. DOJ uses the proceeds from forfeitures primarily to cover the costs of forfeiture activities. DOJ also shares forfeiture proceeds with state and local agencies that participate in joint investigations through its equitable sharing program. GAO was asked to review (1) AFFs revenues and expenditures from fiscal years 2003 through 2011 and DOJs processes for carrying over funds for the next fiscal year, and (2) the extent to which DOJ has established controls to help ensure that the equitable sharing program is implemented in accordance with established guidance. GAO analyzed data on AFF revenues, expenditures, and balances; interviewed DOJ officials; and analyzed a sample of 25 equitable sharing determinations, which included 5 determinations from each relevant DOJ agency. GAOs analysis of the samples was not generalizable, but provided insight into DOJs decisions. Annual revenues into the Assets Forfeiture Fund (AFF) from forfeited assets increased from $500 million in 2003 to $1.8 billion in 2011, in part due to an increase in prosecutions of fraud and financial crimes cases. Expenditures in support of forfeiture activities such as equitable sharing payments to state and local law enforcement agencies and payments to victims also increased over the same 9-year period, growing from $458 million in 2003 to $1.3 billion in 2011. The Department of Justice (DOJ) uses the difference between revenues and expenditures in any year to help cover anticipated expenses in the next fiscal year. Because the AFF uses fund revenues to pay for the expenses associated with forfeiture activities, DOJ carries over funds at the end of each fiscal year to ensure it has sufficient resources to cover expenses that may not be covered by the next years revenues. When determining the amounts to carry over, DOJ reviews historical data on past program expenditures, analyzes known future expenses such as salaries and contracts, and estimates the costs of any potential new expenditures. However, DOJ has not documented the process for determining the amount of funds needed to cover anticipated expenditures in the next fiscal year in its annual budget justifications. Providing more transparent information as part of the AFFs annual budget process would better inform Congress oversight of the AFF. Further, after DOJ obligates funds needed to cover program expenses, any remaining AFF funds identified at the end of a fiscal year may be declared an excess unobligated balance. DOJ has the authority to use these balances for any of the departments authorized purposes. Per Office of Management and Budget guidance, in recent years, DOJ used these excess unobligated balances to help cover rescissions. Rescissions cancel the availability of DOJs previously enacted budget authority, making the funds involved no longer available for obligation. For example, in fiscal year 2011, DOJ used excess unobligated balances to help cover a $495 million AFF program rescission. DOJ has established guidelines for making equitable sharing determinations, but controls to ensure consistency and transparency could be improved. For example, DOJ agencies responsible for making equitable sharing determinations may make adjustments to sharing percentages when work hours alone do not reflect the relative value of an agencys contribution to an investigation. If a state or local law enforcement agency contributed a helicopter or a drug-sniffing dog to an investigation, its sharing percentage might be adjusted upward from what it would be based on work hours alone. However, DOJs guidance does not include information regarding how decisions about these adjustments to sharing determinations should be made. This is particularly important given that these determinations represent DOJs overall assessment of each agencys unique contributions and are a key component of how DOJ determines how much to award to each agency. Furthermore, key information that serves as the basis for equitable sharing determinationssuch as the work hours contributed by each of the participating agencies in an investigationis not subject to review by approving authorities. Developing guidance regarding how these decisions are to be made, documenting the basis for these decisions, and subjecting them to review and approval would help ensure the consistency and transparency of equitable sharing determinations. GAO recommends that, among other things, DOJ clearly document how it determines the amount of funds that will need to be carried over for the next fiscal year, develop guidance on how components should make adjustments to equitable sharing determinations, and ensure that the basis for equitable sharing determinations is documented and subjected to review and approval. DOJ concurred with GAOs recommendations.", "prediction": "Table 3 shows the enacted rescissions for each fiscal year, as well as the unobligated balances used by DOJ in order to meet the rescissions. As a result, agency headquarters officials note that they have limited resources to verify the basis for each and every equitable sharing determination. This allows DOJ to ensure that the AFF has sufficient resources at the start of each fiscal year to cover solvency and pending equitable sharing and third-party payments."}
{"index": 5, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Under the EB-5 Program Regional Center model, first enacted as a pilot program in 1992 and reauthorized numerous times since, a certain number of the EB-5 visas are set aside annually for immigrant investors investing within economic units called regional centers, which are established to promote economic growth. Most recently, the EB-5 Program Regional Center model was extended until September 30, 2016. Immigrant investors can choose to invest on their own or with others directly in a business, or they may use a regional center to pool their investment with those of other immigrant investors and other foreign and U.S. investors to develop larger projects owned and managed by others. Immigrant investors must demonstrate that their investment in a new commercial enterprise will result in the creation or, in the case of a troubled business, preservation or creation (or some combination of the two), of at least 10 full-time positions for qualifying employees. In recent years, the EB-5 Program has increased in popularity as a viable source of low-interest funding for major real estate development projects, such as the Barclays Center—a multipurpose indoor arena in Brooklyn, New York—and the Marriott Convention Center Hotel in Washington, D.C. Individuals seeking to establish a regional center under the EB-5 Program must submit an initial application and supporting documentation as well as an update for each fiscal year (or as otherwise requested by USCIS) showing that the regional center continues to meet the program requirements to maintain its regional-center designation. Prospective regional-center principals apply to the program by submitting Form I-924, Application for Regional Center under the Immigrant Investor Pilot Program. On this form, applicants are to provide a proposal, supported by economically or statistically valid forecasting tools, that describes, among other things, how the regional center (1) focuses on a geographic area of the United States; (2) will promote economic growth through increased export sales and improved regional productivity, job creation, and increased domestic capital investment; and (3) will create jobs directly or indirectly. Applicants must also include a detailed statement regarding the amount and source of capital committed to the regional center, as well as a description of the promotional efforts they have taken and planned. Once a regional center has been approved to participate in the program, a designated representative of the regional center must file a Form I-924A, Supplement to Form I-924, for each fiscal year, to provide USCIS with updated information demonstrating that the regional center continues to promote economic growth, improved regional productivity, job creation, or increased domestic capital investment within its approved geographic area. USCIS is to issue a notice of intent to terminate the participation of a regional center if the center fails to submit the required information or upon a determination that the regional center no longer serves the purpose of promoting economic growth. As shown in figure 1, prospective immigrant investors seeking to participate in the EB-5 Program must complete three forms and provide supporting documentation as appropriate. Supporting documentation is assessed to ensure that the prospective immigrant investors have met (1) the terms of participation for the program, (2) criteria for lawful admission for permanent residence on a conditional basis, and (3) requirements of the program to have the conditional basis of his or her lawful permanent resident status removed. As of August 2016, USCIS had approved approximately 851 regional centers spread across 48 states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories; and had terminated the participation of 61 regional centers for not filing a Form I-924A or not promoting economic growth. The Fraud Risk Framework identifies leading practices for agencies to manage fraud risks. It includes control activities that help agencies prevent, detect, and respond to fraud risks as well as structures and environmental factors that influence or help managers achieve their objectives to mitigate fraud risks. The framework consists of four components for effectively managing fraud risks: commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt (see fig. 2). Leading practices for each of these components include the following: (1) commit: create an organizational culture to combat fraud at all levels of the agency, and designate an entity within the program office to lead fraud risk management activities; (2) assess: assess the likelihood and impact of fraud risks, determine risk tolerance, examine the suitability of existing controls, and prioritize residual risks; (3) design and implement: develop, document, and communicate an antifraud strategy, focusing on preventive control activities; and (4) evaluate and adapt: collect and analyze data from reporting mechanisms and instances of detected fraud for real-time monitoring of fraud trends, and use the results of monitoring, evaluations, and investigations to improve fraud prevention, detection, and response. Since August 2015, USCIS has continued to take steps intended to enhance its fraud-detection activities. This includes conducting and planning risk assessments to gather additional information on potential fraud risks to the program. USCIS is also taking steps to collect more applicant and petitioner information through a random site visit pilot and expanding its use of background checks, among other things, to help improve its ability to identify specific incidence of fraud. Further, USCIS has taken preliminary steps to digitize and analyze the paper files submitted by petitioners and applicants to the program. However, the EB- 5 Program is hampered by a reliance on voluminous paper files, and failing to carry through with these planned efforts could limit USCIS’s ability to improve fraud risk management. USCIS is currently conducting multiple risk assessments to help assess fraud risks to the program and has plans for future assessments. DHS concurred with our August 2015 recommendation that USCIS plan and conduct regular fraud risk assessments of the EB-5 Program in the future. In January 2016 and April 2016, USCIS officials updated us about their ongoing actions to conduct and plan risk assessments for the program. These assessments include a current study of potential fraud associated with certain immigrant investors’ source of funds, a random site visit pilot that is planned for completion later this year, and a planned study of all national-security concerns associated with the program: Source-of-funds study: FDNS is leveraging overseas staff to attempt to identify potential sources of fraud stemming from immigrant investors’ false statements regarding their source of funds to provide their investment in the program. Site-visit pilot: According to agency officials’ statements and documentation we reviewed, FDNS is designing and implementing a plan to conduct random site visits. According to agency officials, the visits will also serve to improve their assessment of fraud risks, and, according to documentation, will be random, in-person, and unannounced, and are intended to, among other things, provide enhanced integrity of the EB-5 program by increasing compliance with statutory and regulatory requirements, as well as deterring regional center and investor fraud. According to agency officials and agency documentation, a total of 50 site visits in four different states are planned. An agency official stated that the first site visits began in August 2016. Another official stated that they anticipate conducting additional site visits on both a continual and as-needed basis. National-security concerns: In April 2016, FDNS officials stated that they also planned to conduct a risk assessment of all previously identified national-security concerns for the program but did not have final details to provide at the time of our review. Based on past and current risk assessments, a senior FDNS official stated that the most frequent incidents of fraud in the program were associated with securities fraud, whereby immigrant investors were defrauded by unscrupulous regional-center principals and their associates. The official’s comments are consistent with our August 2015 findings that over half of ongoing investigations associated with the program related to securities fraud. In our report we also noted that the EB-5 program faced unique fraud risks compared to other immigration programs that included uncertainties in verifying that the funds invested were obtained lawfully and various investment-related schemes to defraud investors. For example, we reported that in one instance, a couple created a regional center and solicited immigrant investors with promises of investing in a local energy company. Instead of investing in that project, the couple used investor funds to, among other things, buy cars for themselves and regional-center employees, and invest in a financially troubled restaurant. Along with its risk assessments, since August 2015, USCIS has continued to take steps to improve its ability to identify potential instances of fraud. USCIS is taking various steps to capture and utilize additional information from its immigrant investor and regional-center program participants and is obtaining additional resources to aid its oversight. These actions were taken in part as a response to our August 2015 recommendation for USCIS to develop a strategy to expand information collection to strengthen fraud prevention, detection, and mitigation capabilities. According to USCIS officials, the EB-5 program has issued updated petition and application forms for public comment and anticipates publishing the revised forms in final in fiscal year 2017. These updated forms would help capture additional information about petitioners and applicants that could be used to potentially identify fraud. Along with capturing additional self-reported information from petitioners and applicants, USCIS officials stated that they are exploring increased use of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) checks to identify potential fraudulent actors in the program, especially for regional-center applicants. Moreover, USCIS is exploring the potential use of a new process to allow interviews of immigrant investor petitioners seeking the removal of their conditional status at the I-829 stage, according to agency officials and documentation. According to agency documentation, this effort is in part a response to our August 2015 report, which recommended that USCIS develop a strategy to expand information collection such as considering the increased use of interviews at the I-829 phase. If implemented, the interviews will be conducted by knowledgeable USCIS officials based in Washington, D.C. As of August 2016, the officials stated that a limited number of pilot interviews had already taken place, and, as a result of these and additional pilot interviews, USCIS plans to refine and develop a comprehensive interview strategy. Further, to help the EB-5 program improve oversight, USCIS officials stated that they are working to improve their ability to track and report data related to EB-5 investments and job creation through the planned development of a case-management system. In August 2016, USCIS officials reported that a preliminary scoping meeting had been held and that project completion was tentatively planned for some time in fiscal year 2017. USCIS is also taking steps to obtain additional resources for program oversight. For example, FDNS has increased its number of authorized positions from 21 to 25 full-time equivalent staff and has added student intern positions and administrative support. According to agency officials and documentation, USCIS’s IPO has also created a specialized group focused primarily on regulatory compliance of existing regional centers to help ensure that the centers continue to serve their purpose of promoting economic growth. Among other things, the compliance unit is expected to help coordinate referrals, such as potential fraud referrals, to FDNS and house an audit function, which anticipates conducting its first audit activities later in 2016. Officials expect that the audits will be conducted on-site at regional centers and that they will include a review of the centers’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Most recently, USCIS has also issued proposed changes for public comment to increase the filing fees for immigrant investors and regional-center applicants either seeking to participate or currently participating in the program. Specifically, USCIS has proposed more than doubling the initial Form I-526 filing fee from $1,500 to $3,675, nearly tripling the I-924 regional- center designation or amendment fee from $6,230 to $17,795, and adding a new I-924A annual filing fee of $3,035. These new fees are designed to allow USCIS to fully recover the costs of the services it provides and also aid its efforts in administering the program including fraud-identification efforts. For example, the proposed rule requests increased fees to conduct additional oversight work such as through site visits. Moreover, USCIS officials stated that they are also developing standard operating procedures for adjudication staff for each immigrant investor form, which the agency plans to finalize by the end of calendar year 2016 or the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. These new procedures could help standardize and improve USCIS’s adjudication processes, which could improve the ability of its staff to detect potential instances of fraud. We found in August 2015 that USCIS is unable to comprehensively identify and address fraud trends across the program because of its reliance on paper-based documentation and because it faces certain limitations with using available data and with collecting additional data on EB-5 immigrant investors or investments. Agency officials noted that the state of information within the program precluded certain fraud-detection and analysis efforts such as the development of an automated risk- weighting system to prioritize petitions and applications at higher risk of fraud. These issues continue to exist. Based on our review of 20 applications and petitions, we similarly determined that identifying fraud indicators in these petitions and applications is extremely challenging. These challenges exist in part because many of the files were several thousand pages long and would take significant time to review. According to USCIS documentation, the program anticipates receiving around 14,000 petitions and applications a year, and the average submission is approximately 1,000 pages in length, for a cumulative total of about 14 million pages that, based on current capabilities, would need to be reviewed manually. According to agency documentation, the average review time for an EB-5 filing can range from 5.5 hours for an I-829 removal of conditions petition to 40 hours for an I-924 application for a new regional center. We also found in August 2015 that USCIS planned to collect and maintain more readily available data on EB-5 Program petitioners and applicants through the deployment of electronic forms in its new system, the USCIS Electronic Immigration System (ELIS). However, according to agency officials, they do not anticipate capturing supporting information provided as evidence in the petitions and applications in USCIS ELIS in the near term. According to an FDNS official, this supporting information can be an important source of potential fraud indicators as it contains details such as business plans associated with the investment. Recognizing the limitations associated with its reliance on paper files, in January 2016 USCIS officials stated that they were analyzing alternatives to evaluate and compare the effectiveness, suitability, costs, and risks associated with different potential hardware and software solutions to detect fraud patterns across its EB-5 applications. In February 2016, USCIS completed a draft of this study, which evaluated both hardware and software options to support fraud detection in both the EB-5 and asylum programs. The study evaluated several document-conversion alternatives including hardware and software tools to scan paper files and convert them to digital text, as well as text analytic alternatives such as software that allows for the detailed analysis of text similar to that used for computer-aided plagiarism detection. For example, this software could be used to identify duplicate passages in different petitions and applications, which could indicate potential fraud. The study reported a number of challenges associated with digitizing and analyzing petitioner and applicant information for the EB-5 program. For example, the study noted that implementing text analytic techniques for computer-aided plagiarism detection will likely be costly since many software packages do not offer this capability without substantial modification. Based on the results of this study, USCIS officials told us that they were developing a set of proposals for management review and potential approval; however, these efforts remained in their development stages and were being reviewed by USCIS stakeholders for feedback, recommendation, and acceptance prior to procurement activities. FDNS officials stated that, at this time, they were optimistic that actions would be taken but were ultimately uncertain to what extent, if any, the proposals would be acted upon. USCIS continues to take steps to improve overall fraud risk management but has not incorporated certain leading practices that could benefit its efforts. Generally, USCIS has followed or partially followed selected leading practices identified in GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework, such as having a commitment to establishing a culture of fraud risk management in the agency. However, USCIS has not developed a fraud risk profile, a component of the Fraud Risk Framework that helps inform an agency’s decisions and plans to mitigate fraud risks. USCIS has taken some key steps that align with the leading practices in the Fraud Risk Framework. In particular, USCIS has taken actions that closely align with the first and second components, which call for federal managers to (1) commit to combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk management; and (2) plan regular fraud risk assessments and assess risks to determine a fraud risk profile. For example, USCIS officials stated that they are committed to creating an organizational culture to combat fraud at all agency levels through leadership that is committed to assessing fraud risks and for training at all levels for adjudicators. In August 2015, we reported that FDNS had also developed and provided training on specific fraud-related topics believed to be immediately relevant to adjudication of EB-5 Program petitions and applications. We found that FDNS is the unit charged with preventing, detecting, and responding to allegations of fraud in the program and represents a dedicated entity for managing fraud risks, which is consistent with the Fraud Risk Framework’s leading practices. With respect to assessing risks, as mentioned previously, USCIS is currently conducting multiple assessments to help it identify and manage EB-5 program fraud risks. The Fraud Risk Framework calls for agencies to plan regular fraud risk assessments to determine a fraud risk profile. We found that the risk assessments conducted for the program generally aligned with this component of the Fraud Risk Framework. For example, through one of these prior risk assessments, USCIS determined that enhanced security checks conducted by other federal entities, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, revealed information that could help identify potential fraud by the immigrant investor or the regional-center principal. As a result, USCIS now conducts selected background checks on all of its immigrant investors and regional-center principals. Most recently, according to a senior FDNS official, USCIS also signed a memorandum of understanding with FinCEN and anticipates conducting additional reviews to help identify potential fraudulent financial activity in its regional centers. While USCIS has taken steps to implement selected leading fraud- management practices, we found that USCIS has not developed a fraud risk profile—an overarching document that guides an organization’s fraud-management efforts—as called for by the Fraud Risk Framework. Specifically, a fraud risk profile involves identifying inherent fraud risks affecting a program; assesses the likelihood and impact of these risks; determines a fraud risk tolerance; and examines the suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizes residual fraud risks. (App. I describes the key elements of a fraud risk profile.) Instead, USCIS’s completed and planned risk assessments span multiple years and were developed as separate documents and reports, and USCIS lacks a unifying document that consolidates these findings and informs the specific control activities managers design and implement. A senior FDNS official told us that FDNS is beginning the development of a fraud-management plan to help guide efforts for the program, but these efforts were in their early stages. Moreover, the official stated that they did not anticipate incorporating a fraud risk profile as part of their fraud-management plan. Without a profile, managers may lack an important tool that can serve as an internal benchmark in assessing the performance of fraud-control activities. Further, a profile can provide additional assurances to stakeholders and decision makers on the fraud risks to programs as well as steps taken to manage those risks. This fraud risk profile can include all elements of the prior risk assessments and any updates, serving as a central reference document that can inform and help initiate actions. Absent a fraud risk profile, USCIS may not be well positioned to identify and prioritize fraud risks in the EB-5 Program and ensure the appropriate controls are in place to mitigate these risks. USCIS has taken a number of steps recently to enhance its fraud- detection capabilities throughout the EB-5 Program. However, the anticipated benefits of these steps may take time to realize. In the meantime, the agency continues to be hindered by a reliance on time- consuming reviews of paper files that preclude certain potential fraud- detection activities such as the use of text analytics to help identify indicators of potential fraud in the applications and petitions of regional- center principals and immigrant investors. The continuation of planned efforts to digitize the files, including the supporting evidence submitted by applicants and petitioners, could help USCIS better identify fraud indicators in the program. Moreover, USCIS has incorporated several leading fraud risk management practices into its efforts, including committing to creating an organizational culture that combats fraud risks and assessing those risks through regular risk assessments. However, USCIS would be better positioned to prioritize and respond to evolving fraud risks by adopting an approach that is guided by a fraud risk profile, as called for by the Fraud Risk Framework. To strengthen USCIS’s EB-5 Program fraud risk management, we recommend the Director of USCIS develop a fraud risk profile that aligns with leading practices identified in GAO’s Fraud Risk Framework. We provided a draft of this report to DHS for its review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix II, DHS concurred with our recommendation and stated that USCIS will develop a fraud risk profile as described with estimated completion by September 30, 2017. We will continue to monitor the agency’s efforts in this area. Upon completion and use of a fraud risk profile to guide its fraud risk management, USCIS will be better positioned to prioritize and respond to evolving fraud risks. DHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate. We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional committees and the Secretary of Homeland Security. In addition, the report is available at no charge on the GAO website at http://www.gao.gov. If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact me at (202) 512-6722 or bagdoyans@gao.gov. Contact points for our Offices of Congressional Relations and Public Affairs may be found on the last page of this report. In addition to the contact named above, Gabrielle Fagan and Linda Miller, Assistant Directors; Jon Najmi; Anna Maria Ortiz; Brynn Rovito; Kiran Sreepada; and Nick Weeks made key contributions to this report. The Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (Fraud Risk Framework) identifies leading practices for agencies to manage fraud risks. It includes control activities that help agencies prevent, detect, and respond to fraud risks as well as structures and environmental factors that influence or help managers achieve their objectives to mitigate fraud risks. The framework consists of four components for effectively managing fraud risks: commit, assess, design and implement, and evaluate and adapt. Leading practices for each of these components include the following: (1) commit: create an organizational culture to combat fraud at all levels of the agency, and designate an entity within the program office to lead fraud risk management activities; (2) assess: assess the likelihood and impact of fraud risks, and determine risk tolerance, examine the suitability of existing controls, and prioritize residual risks; (3) design and implement: develop, document, and communicate an antifraud strategy, focusing on preventive control activities; and (4) evaluate and adapt: collect and analyze data from reporting mechanisms and instances of detected fraud for real-time monitoring of fraud trends, and use the results of monitoring, evaluations, and investigations to improve fraud prevention, detection, and response. The fraud risk profile is an essential piece of the antifraud strategy, as described in the “Design and Implement” section of the Fraud Risk Framework, and informs the specific control activities managers design and implement. The elements in table 1 reflect key elements of fraud risk assessments and the fraud risk profile. The table is meant solely for illustrative purposes to show one possible format for agencies to document their fraud risk profile. The table shows information related to one fraud risk; however, a robust fraud risk profile would include information about all fraud risks that may affect a program. Documenting fraud risks together can aid managers in understanding links between specific risks. In addition, other tools a program uses to assess risks, such as the risk matrix discussed in the “Assess” section of the Fraud Risk Framework, can supplement the documentation for the fraud risk profile. We adapted the table and additional information below it from Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, as well as a publication by the Australian National Audit Office and one cosponsored by the Institute of Internal Auditors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, and the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners. The following is additional information about the elements in table 1. Identified Fraud Risks. What fraud risks does the program face? Include a brief description of the fraud risk or scheme. This list will vary by program, and may be informed by activities to gather information during the fraud risk assessment, such as interviews with staff, brainstorming sessions, and information from hotline referrals. Fraud Risk Factors. What conditions or actions are most likely to cause or increase the chances of a fraud risk occurring? This may reflect fraud risk factors highlighted in Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, as well as other factors that provide additional details about specific fraud risks. Fraud Risk Owner. Which group or individual within the program is responsible for addressing the risk? The owner of the fraud risk will vary by program, but generally the owner this is the entity with accountability for addressing the fraud risk. Inherent Risk Likelihood and Impact. In the absence of controls, how likely is the fraud risk and what would the impact be if it were to occur? As noted in the “Assess” section of the Fraud Risk Framework, the specific methodology for assessing the likelihood and impact of risks will vary by agency. One option for assessing likelihood is to use a five-point scale, as noted in table 1. When considering impact, participants of the fraud risk assessment may consider the impact of fraud on the program’s compliance with laws and regulations, operations, and reputation. Inherent Risk Significance. In the absence of controls, how significant is the fraud risk based on an analysis of the likelihood and impact of the risk? While the specific methodology for assessing risks may vary by agency, including qualitative and quantitative methodologies, managers may multiply the likelihood and impact scores, or apply a five-point scale. Existing Antifraud Controls. What controls does the program already have in place to reduce the likelihood and impact of the inherent fraud risk? This is intended to assist with mapping the existing controls to the fraud risks or schemes, which would reduce the likelihood and impact of a fraud risk occurring. Residual Risk Likelihood and Impact. Taking into account the effectiveness of existing controls, how likely is the fraud risk and what would the impact be if it were to occur? Managers may consider assessing both the residual likelihood and impact of fraud risks using the five-point scale described in table 1. Controls that are not properly designed or operating effectively may contribute to high residual risk. Residual Risk Significance. How significant is the fraud risk based on an analysis of the likelihood and impact, as well as the effectiveness of existing controls? Like inherent risk significance, qualitative and quantitative methodologies may be used to establish residual risk significance. Fraud Risk Response. What actions does the program plan to address the fraud risk, if any, in order to bring fraud risks within managers’ risk tolerance?", "reference": "Congress created the EB-5 visa category to promote job creation and capital investment by immigrant investors in exchange for lawful permanent residency and a path to citizenship. Participants must invest either $500,000 or $1 million in a business that is to create at least 10 jobs. Upon meeting program requirements, immigrant investors are eligible for conditional status to live and work in the United States and can apply to remove the conditional basis of lawful permanent residency after 2 years. In August 2015, GAO reported on weaknesses in certain USCIS fraud mitigation activities, and made two related recommendations. GAO was asked to review actions taken by USCIS to address fraud risks in the EB-5 program since its August 2015 report. This report examines the extent to which USCIS (1) has taken steps to enhance its fraud detection and mitigation efforts; and (2) has incorporated selected leading fraud risk management practices into its efforts. GAO reviewed relevant program documentation and information; selected and reviewed a random, nongeneralizable sample of immigrant investor petitions and regional-center applications submitted between fiscal years 2010 and 2014; and compared USCIS's actions against GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. The Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has recently taken steps intended to enhance fraud detection and mitigation activities for the Employment-Based Fifth Preference Immigrant Investor Program (EB-5 Program) and address previous GAO recommendations. This includes actions such as conducting and planning additional risk assessments to gather additional information on potential fraud risks to the program. For example, USCIS is leveraging overseas staff to investigate potential fraud associated with unlawful sources of immigrant investor funds and is conducting a site visit pilot to help assess the potential risks of fraud among EB-5 program investments. USCIS is also taking steps to collect more information about EB-5 program investments and immigrant investors through new, revised forms and expanding its use of background checks, among other things, to help improve its ability to identify specific incidence of fraud. However, fraud mitigation in the EB-5 Program is hindered by a reliance on voluminous paper files, which limit the agency's ability to collect and analyze program information. In its review of a nongeneralizable selection of files associated with EB-5 program regional centers and immigrant investors, GAO found that identifying fraud indicators is extremely challenging. For example, many of these files were several thousand pages long and would take significant time to review. According to USCIS documentation, the program anticipates receiving approximately 14 million pages of supporting documentation from its regional-center applicants and immigrant investor petitioners annually. Recognizing these limitations, USCIS has taken preliminary steps to study digitizing and analyzing the paper files submitted by petitioners and applicants to the program, which could help USCIS better identify fraud indicators in the program; however, these efforts are in the early stages. USCIS has incorporated selected leading fraud risk management practices into its efforts but could take additional actions to help guide and document its efforts. GAO's Fraud Risk Framework is a set of leading practices that can serve as a guide for program managers to use when developing efforts to combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based manner. USCIS's actions align with two key components of the Fraud Risk Framework: (1) commit to combating fraud by creating an organizational culture and structure conducive to fraud risk management such as by providing specialized fraud awareness training; and (2) assess risks by planning and completing regular fraud risk assessments. However, USCIS has not developed a fraud risk profile, an overarching document that guides its fraud management efforts, as called for in the Fraud Risk Framework. Instead, USCIS's risk assessments, spanning multiple years, were developed as separate documents and reports, and there is not a unifying document that consolidates and systematically prioritizes these findings. Without a fraud risk profile, USCIS may not be well positioned to identify and prioritize fraud risks in the EB-5 Program, ensure the appropriate controls are in place to mitigate fraud risks, and implement other Fraud Risk Framework components. GAO recommends that USCIS develop a fraud risk profile that aligns with leading practices identified in GAO's Fraud Risk Framework. The Department of Homeland Security concurred with GAO's recommendation.", "prediction": "USCIS is currently conducting multiple risk assessments to help assess fraud risks to the program and has plans for future assessments. Along with its risk assessments, since August 2015, USCIS has continued to take steps to improve its ability to identify potential instances of fraud. With respect to assessing risks, as mentioned previously, USCIS is currently conducting multiple assessments to help it identify and manage EB-5 program fraud risks."}
{"index": 6, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Medicaid is a federal-state entitlement program that pays for health care and related services on behalf of certain low-income individuals. All states participate in Medicaid, but participation is not required. If states participate, then under federal Medicaid law they are required to provide health service benefits to certain individuals—mandatory eligibility groups—but states have the option of covering other groups too. Similarly, states must cover certain services for mandatory eligibility groups, but they have the option to cover fewer services for other eligibility groups. In general, Medicaid health benefits are broad for mandatory eligibility groups, but more restricted for other eligibility groups. Prescription drugs are an optional Medicaid benefit, but all states cover outpatient drugs. States may create formularies, lists of preferred drugs, but federal rules tend to result in comprehensive coverage, even for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans. Since 1990, pharmaceutical manufacturers who voluntarily agree to participate in Medicaid are required to rebate a portion of drug payments back to states. When a manufacturer participates in Medicaid, states must make most of their drugs available to Medicaid beneficiaries. States share the rebates they receive from drug manufacturers with the federal government. The drug rebates required under federal law help the state and federal Medicaid program receive manufacturers' lowest or best price . Beginning in 2010, drug manufacturers also were required to pay rebates on drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care. For the purpose of determining rebates, Medicaid distinguishes between two drug types: (1) single source drugs (generally, those still under patent) and innovator multiple source drugs (drugs originally marketed under a patent or original new drug application but for which there now are generic equivalents); and (2) all other, non-innovator, multiple source drugs. Rebates for the first category of drugs—drugs still under patent or those once covered by patents—have two components: a basic rebate and an additional rebate. Medicaid's basic rebate for single source and innovator multiple source drugs is the larger of either the difference between a drug's quarterly average manufacturer price (AMP) and the best price for the same period, or a flat percentage (23.1%) of the drug's quarterly AMP. Drug manufacturers owe an additional rebate when their unit prices for individual products increased faster than inflation. For all other drugs, the rebate is a flat percentage (13%) of a drug's quarterly AMP. States separately negotiate additional, supplemental, rebates with drug manufacturers in exchange for listing manufacturer products on the state's preferred drug list. State Medicaid agencies reimburse retail pharmacies for covered outpatient prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid FFS payments to pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs have two components: a payment to cover the cost of the pharmacy buying the drug (the ingredient cost) and a payment for the pharmacist's professional services in filling and dispensing the prescription (the dispensing fee). States, subject to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) approval, set reimbursement amounts for both ingredient costs and dispensing fees. Dispensing fees usually are a fixed amount, intended to cover the procuring and storing drugs, consultation, and dispensing drugs. The ingredient cost component of the pharmacy payment is an approximation of a drug's market price which is intended to reimburse the pharmacy for the cost of acquiring the drug. To encourage substitution of lower-cost generic equivalent drugs for more expensive sole source drugs, federal law requires CMS to set a maximum on what it will pay for certain multiple source drug ingredients. The maximum multiple drug ingredient payments are called federal upper limits (FULs). Based on state FY2013 Medicaid financial reports, Medicaid FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures, net of federal and state rebates, were $16.2 billion, down from $30.7 billion in FY2005 ( Figure 1 ). However, decreases in Medicaid FFS drug expenditures do not represent an overall decrease in Medicaid prescription drug expenditures, because there have been prescription drug industry trends as well as a number of statutory changes that have shifted Medicaid drug expenditures to other spending accounts. For instance, beginning January 1, 2006, prescription drug coverage of disabled and elderly Medicaid beneficiaries—those covered by both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles)—was moved from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. Dual eligibles accounted for a considerable portion of Medicaid drug expenditures, and as a result, when they were moved to Medicare Part D, Medicaid drug expenditures decreased. A maintenance of effort (MOE) provision in federal Medicare law required states to continue to pay the vast majority of dual eligible drug costs. Another factor that contributed to the decline in FFS drug expenditures is the recent escalation in the movement of Medicaid beneficiary drug coverage from FFS to managed care contracts that include drug coverage. One indicator of the movement to managed care coverage of drugs was the growth in managed care rebates, which were required beginning in FY2010. In FY2011, states collected $932 million (national and state supplemental rebates) in managed care rebates, which increased to $4.7 billion in FY2013 ( Table 5 ). Another indicator of the migration to managed care is the change in the number of FFS drug claims, which declined by almost 25% between FY2011-FY2012 ( Table C-1 ). Decreased drug claims for five states accounted for over 90% of the decrease. The statutory changes helped to increase overall rebate collections, which had the effect of reducing net drug expenditures. States reported collecting a total of $11.7 billion in federally required FFS rebates and an additional $726 million in state FFS supplemental drug rebates, and $4.7 billion in managed care rebates for a total of $17.2 billion in FY2013 ( Table 7 and Table 6 ). Other factors that contributed to the decline in FFS drug expenditures were drug industry trends and changes in Medicaid laws applicable to prescription drugs. The drug industry patent cliff, where a number of blockbuster drugs came off patent over a few years, reduced Medicaid FFS drug costs as these drugs became available as cheaper generic products. Selected other Medicaid FFS prescription drug data show that average FY2013 per-person Medicaid prescription drug expenditures were just over $926 ( Table 11 ), down from $1,509 in FY2005. In FY2012, Medicaid on average paid approximately $282 for single source prescription drug claims, $149 for innovator multiple source claims, and $18 for non-innovator multiple source drug claims ( Table 12 ). Medicaid's generic prescribing rate for all states varies; the national average in FY2012 was 76% ( Table D-1 ). The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA, P.L. 111-148 ) made a number of modifications to federal Medicaid law. The CMS published a proposed rule that provided guidance on implementation of the ACA changes in February 2012. A final rule that would codify many of the new Medicaid drug requirements is pending as of the date of this report. In December 2013, Sovaldi ® a new brand name drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis virus C (HVC) infections. Sovaldi was estimated to cost $1,000 per pill and total treatment cost estimates can range from $84,000 to more than $168,000. Through federal health programs, including Medicaid's prescription drug benefit, federal and state governments may pay the majority of HVC treatment costs. Sovaldi has raised an issue because of its high price and that many individuals with HCV infections are covered by Medicaid. For Medicaid, states and the federal government will receive rebates for Sovaldi that will help reduce the drug's cost, but until other equivalent drugs are available to increase competition, states may have limited leverage to negotiate additional manufacturer price concessions. Medicaid rebates, while buffering the cost of prescription drugs somewhat, might also contribute to drug manufacturers setting increasingly higher launch prices. Medicaid's drug pricing and policy have been effective in helping to control Medicaid FFS drug expenditures. Outpatient drug expenditures have decreased and Medicaid is able to buy drugs for lower prices than Medicare Part D plans, the other major federal outpatient prescription drug purchaser. Congress has been instrumental in establishing state and federal authority to ensure Medicaid receives manufacturers' lowest prescription drug prices. Congress authorized creation of Medicaid program infrastructure to manage, monitor, and enforce prescription drug pricing. However, if the pace in the movement of Medicaid enrollees to managed care that includes prescription drug benefits continues, then prescription drug oversight may be more difficult. The current Medicaid drug pricing and policy infrastructure was designed for FFS, and may not work as well with significant managed care enrollment. States have authority to collect rebates under managed care arrangements, although how state supplemental rebates will align with managed care plan drug discount negotiations is unclear. Under managed care contracts, states generally delegate some or all of drug utilization review and individual drug claim oversight to plans, including program integrity. When managed care and PBMs are responsible for these activities, states have responsibility for ensuring plans uphold their contract obligations. States' prescription drug monitoring is tailored to FFS drug claims, and it is unclear how much oversight of managed care claims states will be able to provide. If states and the federal government currently procure drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries at some of the lowest prices, will it be possible for managed care plans and PBMs to further reduce costs without imposing barriers to Medicaid beneficiaries in obtain covered drugs? Medicaid drug pricing and policy is complex, in part because prescription drug markets are dynamic. Drug manufacturers and wholesalers adapt to policy and statutory changes by creating new products and new marketing approaches that sometimes circumvent Medicaid pricing rules. Drug companies and health insurers operate in private markets in which they are seeking private advantages to earn revenue and profits. Medicaid pricing policies are, in part, based on competitive market transactions. Even though Medicaid buys drugs through the same markets as other payers, federal law requires drug companies, operating through wholesalers and distributors, to sell drugs to Medicaid at discounted prices. Medicaid's drug discounts vary depending on whether drugs are available from one manufacturer—single source—or are available from two or more manufacturers—multiple source. Single source drug discounts are greater than multiple source drug discounts. In 2010, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that total single source Medicaid drug rebates averaged approximately 57% of manufacturers' average prices. This report discusses how Medicaid pays for drugs, including statutory requirements on manufacturers and states as well as a number of regulations and policies that help to administer the program. Medicaid beneficiaries are dispensed drugs at retail pharmacies, but states pay most of the cost of those drugs. States then receive discounts from drug manufacturers in the form of rebate payments, which states share with the federal government through a credit against states' future Medicaid payments. Since 2006, the amount states and the federal government have spent on drugs for beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service (FFS) Medicaid has decreased whereas the amount states have collected from rebates has increased. The focus of this report is on FFS prescription drug pricing and policy. FFS drug spending accounted for the vast majority of Medicaid drug purchases in 2010, with CBO estimating that prescription drug purchases on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care contracts represented approximately 10% of Medicaid drug expenditures. However, Medicaid managed care contracts including prescription drug coverage have grown very rapidly since FY2010. Data for Medicaid managed care drug expenditures are not as readily available as those for FFS drug spending because those expenditures are not separately reported on Medicaid financial reporting forms. Nonetheless, when possible or appropriate, information on managed care prescription drug spending and utilization is included in the discussion in this report, but in general managed care drug expenditures and utilization are outside its scope. There is considerable Medicaid and related health expenditure data present throughout this report. These data are nominal and have not been inflation adjusted. This report will be revised as new data and information become available. A number of Medicaid drug pricing terms are commonly abbreviated. Table 1 displays many of the Medicaid drug-related acronyms and abbreviations that appear in this report. In addition, Table 2 displays a list of public laws referenced throughout the report, and Table E-1 in Appendix E is a glossary of selected Medicaid drug terms. Medicaid is a federal-state entitlement program that pays for medical services on behalf of certain low-income individuals. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicaid program under authority delegated by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (the Secretary). Estimated FY2013 federal expenditures for Medicaid benefits and administration were approximately $262 billion; state expenditures were estimated to be an additional $192 billion, for a total program cost of approximately $454 billion. State Medicaid programs are administered and designed by the states under broad federal guidelines. All states elect to participate in Medicaid, so they are required to provide benefits to certain low-income individuals and optionally may cover other individuals. Similarly, states must cover certain basic services, but may also cover additional services. States set their provider payment rates for medical and related services, subject to limitations and federal approval. There is considerable variation across states, with some programs being relatively limited and others more generous in terms of eligible populations, covered benefits, and service payments. Medicaid is a means-tested program. Enrollees' income and other resources must be within program financial standards. These standards vary among states and among different population groups within a state. With some exceptions, Medicaid is available only to very low income individuals—most Medicaid enrollees have incomes below the federal poverty level (FPL). Until recently, Medicaid was primarily available only to children, adult members of families with children, pregnant women, and aged, blind, or disabled individuals. People outside those categories—such as single adults and childless couples—generally did not qualify for Medicaid regardless of their income level. ACA permitted states to expand Medicaid coverage to single adults up to age 65 provided their income did not exceed 133% of FPL and required states to cover mandatory eligibility groups up to 133% of FPL. Historically, Medicaid eligibility groups were divided into two basic classes, the categorically needy and the medically needy. These classes differentiated between beneficiaries who were eligible for Medicaid because their income was low (categorically needy) and those who were eligible because they had high medical expenses (medically needy). Categorically needy Medicaid beneficiaries received cash-assistance payments (welfare), so their eligibility was considered welfare-related. Categorically needy beneficiaries represent the majority of Medicaid beneficiaries. Although their income may have exceeded states' Medicaid income eligibility threshold, medically needy beneficiaries were eligible for Medicaid because a high percentage of that income was used to pay medical expenses, which left only a small amount of income for other living expenses. In 2009, 33 states covered medically needy individuals and these individuals accounted for approximately 5% of national Medicaid enrollment, and 11% of Medicaid expenditures (about $37 billion). Over time, more categorically needy eligibility groups were added. As a result, distinctions between categorically and medically needy eligibility became less useful in identifying which groups qualified for mandatory or optional benefits. Nonetheless, the distinctions are useful when considering certain benefits. Most benefits are considered mandatory only for categorically needy individuals; that is, states must cover those benefits for the categorically needy but they are an option for medically needy individuals. Other benefits, including outpatient prescription drugs, are optional for both groups of beneficiaries. Some states provide those optional benefits only to categorically needy individuals whereas other states provide optional benefits to one or more medically needy groups as well. Coverage of outpatient prescription drugs is optional for state Medicaid programs. All states cover outpatient prescription drugs for mandatory (categorically needy) eligibility groups, but they may not cover drugs for optional groups (including medically needy) and drug coverage for expansion populations may be limited to either benchmark plan coverage or a particular set of drugs. , Most states cover outpatient drugs because these drugs are considered a lower-cost alternative to other medical care. Prescription drugs may help keep enrollees healthier and potentially prevent more serious and more costly medical interventions. In general, Medicaid FFS and managed care outpatient drug benefits are broad, encompassing most prescription drugs and many non-prescription, over-the-counter (OTC), drugs. Medicaid prescription drug coverage is broad because Medicaid law requires states to cover most drugs offered by manufacturers that have rebate agreements in effect. In addition, federal law permits states to use formularies to direct beneficiaries to equivalent lower-cost drugs, but there also must be a process by which health care providers may request covered drugs not on the formulary if the provider determines those drugs are medically necessary. When states contract with managed care plans and drug coverage is included, the plans may use their own formularies but also must have a process by which health care providers can prescribe non-formulary drugs that they determine are medically necessary. For Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in FFS Medicaid, federal statute allows states to establish formularies. Formularies are lists of drugs that payers prefer to have prescribed to beneficiaries, generally because these drugs cost less and are considered by experts to be as safe and effective as other drug choices. When private health care insurers or providers cover only those drugs on the list and deny payment for others, the list is referred to as a closed formulary . Medicaid formularies are seldom as restrictive as the closed formularies found in the private insurance market because of two statutory requirements. The first requirement is that states must cover any non-formulary drug (with the exception of certain drugs) that is specifically requested and approved through a prior authorization process. The second requirement is that states cover all drugs offered by manufacturers that entered into rebate agreements with the Secretary. States may use formularies to exclude drugs for which there are no significant therapeutic advantages over other drugs that are included in the formularies, as long as there is a publicly available explanation for a drug's exclusion. Although federal law ensures Medicaid formularies are not too restrictive, it also allows states to exclude certain drugs, drug classes, or drug uses from Medicaid coverage. States may still cover excluded drugs and receive federal financial participation (FFP) for them. Medicaid-excluded drugs are not subject to the requirement that states must cover all of a manufacturer's products if the manufacturer entered into a Medicaid rebate agreement with the Secretary. Federal Medicaid law also requires states to cover three additional drugs, drug classes, or their medical uses. Many Medicaid managed care arrangements are limited risk-based contracts that rely on primary care case management (PCCM). Under PCCM and similar limited-risk contracts, Medicaid programs pay providers a small fixed fee to manage patients' care. Further, in PCCM and other non-risk bearing managed care arrangements, prescription drug benefits generally are delivered and reimbursed as FFS Medicaid benefits. For Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans, or plans to which states pay a fixed monthly capitation payment in exchange for the provision of all or some subset of covered services, Medicaid statute permits those managed care plans an exception from the FFS drug coverage rules described above. When state Medicaid programs cover drugs or other services, such as mental health or long-term care services and supports, through managed care contracts, the services covered are considered carved in to the managed care contracts. When states do not cover drug benefits or other services, those services are considered carved out of the managed care contracts. Medicaid law allows managed care plans to develop and administer drug formularies. In practice, however, when prescription drugs are covered under capitated managed care contracts, states sometimes require managed care plans to have the same coverage and formulary limits as FFS Medicaid coverage. Only some managed care contracts include prescription drug benefits, although increasingly more include drug coverage. Since 2010, as states have moved to carve-in prescription drug coverage, more states now permit managed care plans to use their own formularies. Even if states delegate formulary decisions to managed care plans, the plans must still provide access to all Medicaid covered drugs, just as required under FFS Medicaid. Medicaid managed care plans may reimburse the retail pharmacy, similar to FFS Medicaid, or they can provide outpatient drugs directly to beneficiaries. As shown in Table 3 , even though the Medicaid managed care enrollment percentage was over 70% in 2011 (for any managed care) these arrangements accounted for only about 25% of Medicaid benefit expenditures, which include drug expenditures. Similarly, 2011 Medicaid benefit expenditures for comprehensive risk-based managed care contracts accounted for about 50% of enrollment but constituted only slightly less than 24% of benefit expenditures, including drug expenditures. Table 3 also displays the Medicaid managed care enrollment increase between FY2008 and FY2011, with rising percentages going to both any managed care and comprehensive risk-based arrangements. Managed care was estimated to account for about 10% of Medicaid prescription drug expenditures in 2010, a figure that was estimated to have increased to approximately 50% in 2013. Many state Medicaid programs also cover OTC drugs, those medications that can be purchased without a prescription. In 2007, all states covered some OTC drugs, although no state covered all OTC drugs and most states limited coverage or imposed coverage restrictions on OTC drugs. All states covered at least some OTC drugs in the following categories: allergy, asthma, and sinus; analgesics; cough and cold; smoking cessation; digestive products; H2 antagonists; feminine products; and topical products. State Medicaid agencies do not purchase drugs directly from manufacturers. Instead, they most commonly reimburse retail pharmacies for covered drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. This section discusses FFS Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement issues. Medicaid payments to pharmacies for outpatient prescription drugs have two components: a payment for what it cost pharmacists to purchase a drug ( ingredient cost ) and a payment for pharmacists' professional services in filling and dispensing prescriptions ( dispensing fee ). States, subject to CMS approval, set separate reimbursement amounts for both ingredient costs and dispensing fees. The pharmacy payment for acquiring the drug, the ingredient cost, is either an approximation of a drug's market price or the amount the pharmacy paid to buy the drug. The dispensing fee is usually a fixed amount, intended to cover drug procurement, storage, and other costs. States set their own pharmacy payments but are subject to some federal limitations. To encourage substitution of lower-cost drugs, federal Medicaid law requires the Secretary to establish a maximum payment amount for the federal share of certain multiple source drug ingredient costs—the federal upper limit (FUL). The FUL program limits the federal share of Medicaid reimbursement for certain multiple source drugs and seeks to ensure that the federal government acts as a prudent buyer by taking advantage of lower market prices for these drugs. Under Medicaid, there are two types of multiple source drugs, innovator multiple source and non-innovator multiple source drugs. Innovator multiple source drugs were initially brand-name drugs that have lost patent protection. Non-innovator multiple source drugs are (1) multiple source drugs that were not initially single source products, (2) multiple source drugs that were marketed as generic products, or (3) drugs that entered the market before 1962 that were never marketed as generic drugs. Brand-name drugs can be single source or innovator multiple source drugs. Generally, CMS must set an FUL amount for drugs when generic versions are available, although states must set upper limits for certain other drugs . Federal FUL policy requires the Secretary to establish a per drug maximum for its share of Medicaid outpatient drug payments. FULs are applied in aggregate to each state's spending for drugs subject to FUL limits rather than to individual prescription drug claims. Thus, a state may reimburse pharmacies at amounts above the FUL for certain drugs and not exceed the sum of FULs in aggregate if it also reimburses pharmacies at amounts below the FUL for other drugs. The FUL aggregate is determined by first multiplying the FUL by the number of units dispensed of each drug. Those amounts are summed for all drugs subject to FULs, and that total represents the maximum amount eligible for FFP. Drugs subject to FULs are those the FDA has rated as having three or more therapeutically and pharmaceutically equivalent products. CMS identifies drugs that are subject to FULs and then calculates the maximum payment amount for those products. The methodology for calculating FULs is to apply a percentage adjustment to the average manufacturer price (AMP) of the least costly therapeutic equivalent. Under an ACA provision, the FUL percentage was decreased from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA, P.L. 109-171 ) rate of 250% of AMP to at least 175% of AMP. Drug manufacturers are required under Medicaid law to report AMP. AMP is defined in statute as the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies (RCPs). CMS has calculated and publically displayed draft FULs using the current law methodology since September 2011 but has not implemented the ACA FUL policy. Thus, current FULs were based on prices in effect in 2009. CMS announced in November 2013 that it would implement the ACA FUL policy July 1, 2014. However, CMS announced in June 2014 that it would delay implementation of the ACA FUL policy, but it did not indicate the length of the delay. Federal Medicaid law also sets upper limits for other drugs a category that includes drugs for which CMS has not established a specific FUL and brand-name drugs that were certified . Drugs that are certified include drugs for which a generic alternative is available, but the beneficiary's physician has specified that a brand name is medically necessary. The FUL for other drugs is determined by the following: Actual acquisition cost (AAC) plus a professional dispensing fee established by the state Medicaid agency; or the pharmacies' usual and customary charges to the general public. States may use any method to set the other drug payment as long as, in the aggregate, state payments for these other drugs are below the levels that would be determined by applying the other drug FUL. The estimated acquisition cost (EAC) is the Medicaid agency's best estimate of the price generally paid by pharmacies and other providers to acquire the drug. CMS allows states flexibility in determining EAC, although many states rely on average wholesale price (AWP) or wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), published prices available from industry compendia. Compendia are reference books or data published by private companies based on data provided by drug manufacturers. Neither AWP nor WAC are necessarily based on actual sales transactions or defined in statute. Thus, both are subject to manufacturers' decisions on what to include or exclude. The AWP is often considered a price for wholesalers to charge retailers. Most states also often develop their own maximum allowable costs (MACs) for drug pricing. States may select the drugs, including multiple source drugs covered by FULs and other drugs, as well as set the reimbursement amount for drugs subject to MACs. MAC programs enable states to achieve additional drug savings by setting lower reimbursement amounts for more multiple source drugs than for those drugs with FUL prices and using a MAC formula that sets prices lower than FUL amounts. In June 2014, CMS identified 45 states with MACs. States are not required to use FULs as the basis for reimbursing pharmacies for outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries. States must only ensure that federal matching funds are not used to pay drug prices that exceed FULs; there are no other federal rules on how states set drug reimbursement, although payment methodologies are approved by CMS through the state plan amendment (SPA) process. In determining what to pay pharmacies for ingredient costs, states estimate current market prices by using one or several benchmarks to approximate pharmacies' acquisition costs. Historically, AWP was the primary drug pricing benchmark used by state Medicaid to set ingredient reimbursement. There has been considerable disagreement about the appropriate basis for setting Medicaid multisource drug ingredient reimbursement since statutory changes were passed in DRA. In FY2009, state Medicaid pharmacy directors issued a white paper on AWP alternatives. One of the white paper's suggestions was that CMS develop a single national pricing benchmark based on average drug ingredient acquisition costs. The state pharmacy directors' AWP alternative white paper argued that a single national benchmark would provide better estimates of pharmacy acquisition costs if it were based on actual drug purchases. This approach to drug ingredient price determination, the Medicaid pharmacy directors argued, also would provide greater accuracy and transparency in how drug prices were established. In their AWP alternative white paper, the Medicaid agencies requested that CMS coordinate, develop, and support a national pricing benchmark that could replace AWP. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that AWPs were artificially inflated, which overstated drug EACs and resulted in Medicaid overpayments. To help states determine ingredient cost reimbursement, the Secretary is required to disclose to states and the general public via a website certain pricing data reported by manufacturers on a monthly basis. The Secretary also is required to disclose the weighted average AMP and an average retail survey price for each multiple source drug. DRA permitted the Secretary to conduct a retail price survey and disclose the survey results to states and the public. CMS initiated a National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC) survey to identify retail community pharmacy (RCP) drug acquisition costs, or the estimated prices RCPs paid to purchase all Medicaid-covered outpatient drugs. CMS began publishing draft drug acquisition cost data on its website in October 2012 and updates NADAC survey data weekly. CMS also initiated a survey of average retail consumer prices but suspended this retail survey due to funding considerations. State Medicaid directors issued an update on the status of state use of AAC, actual acquisition cost, in setting FFS ingredient reimbursement rates. The Medicaid directors indicated that seven states were using an ACC-based rate in 2014, although only one state was using CMS's NADAC survey data. The other states conducted their own AAC surveys. States that used an AAC-based methodology generally had increased dispensing fees to offset the potentially lower ingredient payments to pharmacies. Although many states continue to base their Medicaid drug reimbursement on published retail prices, such as AWPs less some percentage or WACs plus some percentage, more states are beginning to transition to AAC (as discussed in the Medicaid director update). Under Medicaid law, states have discretion to use different formulas or percentages to adjust published prices depending on the drug or drug category (i.e., generic versus brand, physician administered, and blood clotting factors). In addition to a drug ingredient acquisition cost payment, states also pay pharmacies a dispensing fee when they fill a FFS prescription. States determine their dispensing fees, which are limited only insofar as they must be \"reasonable.\" Most dispensing fees generally range from around $1.00 to $3.00 per prescription, but some dispensing fees may reach $10.00 and even more depending on the state methodology and other factors. Dispensing fees may range higher in states that do not use a flat fee. Dispensing fees also often are higher for generics than for single source drugs, and fees can vary by such characteristics as urban or rural location, for profit or non-profit status, and for federally qualified health centers. Some states use tiered dispensing fees, where the rate decreases as a pharmacy's historical annual prescription volume increases. In general, states may set higher dispensing fees to help offset a pharmacy's higher costs for filling certain types of prescriptions or lower profit on reimbursement for ingredients and to encourage generic substitution, where possible. In 1990, Congress amended the Social Security Act (SSA) to add the Medicaid Drug Rebate (MDR) program to Medicaid law. Under the MDR program, drug manufacturers that want to sell their drugs to state Medicaid agencies must enter into rebate agreements with the Secretary on behalf of states. The MDR agreements require drug manufacturers to provide state Medicaid programs with rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries to ensure that Medicaid receives the lowest or best price for which the manufacturer sold the drug during the previous quarter. In exchange for receiving the best price, Medicaid programs must cover all drugs marketed by those manufacturers with certain exceptions. For instance, drugs provided in hospitals and sometimes in physicians' or dentists' offices, or similar settings are exempt from rebates. Drug manufacturers must pay rebates on prescription drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries who receive their care through FFS as well as managed care plans. Drug manufacturers also must pay rebates on some nonprescription, OTC items, such as aspirin, when they are dispensed to a Medicaid beneficiary and covered under the state's Medicaid plan. In 2014, CMS reported there were approximately 610 drug manufacturers participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program. In FY2013, the Medicaid (state and federal) FFS rebates—basic, inflation, and supplemental—were approximately $12.4 billion (see Table 6 ). Medicaid rebates are shared between the states and the federal government according to state federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP). A state's FMAP determines the rate at which the federal government matches states' Medicaid expenditures. Drug manufacturers compute the drug rebate amount owed each quarter based on utilization information supplied by states. States collect manufacturers' rebates and then subtract (offset) the federal share from the federal matching funds they would receive for Medicaid medical benefits. For rebates purposes, federal law distinguishes between two major drug categories, single source drugs and multiple source drugs. Multiple source drugs include innovator multiple source drugs—drugs once covered by patents—and non-innovator multiple source drugs—generic drugs and all other drugs, including drugs developed before FDA approval was required and OTC drugs. In addition to the two major drug types, ACA added several additional single source and innovator multiple source drug types that are treated differently for rebates. These drug types include line extensions, clotting (blood) factors, and drugs approved by the FDA for pediatric indications. The basic and additional rebate formulas for these new ACA drug types as well as single source, innovator multiple source, and non-innovator multiple source are summarized in Table 4 . For single source and innovator multiple source drugs, manufacturers are required to pay state Medicaid programs a basic rebate and, when they raise a drug's price faster than inflation, an additional rebate. As shown in Table 4 , the basic rebate is determined by comparing each drug's per unit AMP to that drug's per unit best price. The basic rebate is the greater of a specified percentage of AMP or the difference between the AMP and the best price. ACA increased the specified percentage of AMP from 15.1% to 23.1%. Manufacturers owe the additional rebate when a single source or innovator multiple source drugs' per unit AMP is raised faster than the inflation rate. The per unit additional rebate is the amount a drug's quarterly reported AMP exceeds the inflation-adjusted base period AMP. If the per unit quarterly AMP does not exceed the inflation-adjusted base period AMP, then no additional rebate is owed. To determine the total rebate, a unit rebate amount for each drug—the sum of the basic and additional rebate—is multiplied by the number of units of the drug that were purchased during the quarter, as determined by the Medicaid agency. For line extension products, any version of the original product's base AMP can be used to determine the additional rebate. As displayed in Table 4 , single source and innovator multiple source pediatric and clotting factor drugs use 17.1% as the percentage to determine the basic rebate amount, but otherwise the rebate calculation, including potential additional rebates, follows the same methodology. Medicaid law limits manufacturers' total rebate obligation for single source and innovator multiple source drugs for each dosage form and strength to no more than the current period AMP. Basic rebates for non-innovator multiple source drugs are equal to 13% of the drug's AMP. Prices offered to other payers are not considered, nor is there an additional rebate for price increases that exceed the inflation rate. In addition to the basic and additional FFS rebates required under federal law, most states negotiate supplemental rebate agreements (SRAs) with prescription drug manufacturers. Although almost all Medicaid SRAs have been for FFS outpatient drugs, in March 2014, three states (Florida, New Hampshire, and Oregon) had submitted SPAs to establish supplemental rebate programs for Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. States can negotiate SRAs on their own or by joining with other states to form purchasing pools. In March 2014, 45 states participated in Medicaid outpatient drug SRAs through single- or multiple-state purchasing pools. States that participate in multi-state purchasing pools are able to combine their purchasing power with that of other states to negotiate greater supplemental rebates and other price concessions from manufacturers. Some states also have established intra-state pools that negotiate drug prices for Medicaid drugs as well as for drugs dispensed through other state agencies such as employee health and local government programs. Generally, states must submit SPAs to CMS outlining their SRA arrangements. Prior to ACA, drug manufacturers were not required to pay rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries by managed care plans. To collect rebates for managed care beneficiaries, states excluded or carved out drug benefits from capitation agreements, then provided drug benefits under FFS or contracted with other entities, such as PBM companies, to provide drug benefits. Beginning in January 2010, prescription drug manufacturers were required under ACA to pay the same rebates that were required under FFS on drugs provided to Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in managed care plans. Since ACA became law, some states have carved in prescription drug benefits to their managed care contracts, so that drugs are covered under these contracts. Managed care rebates are paid to states and shared with the federal government following the same formulas as FFS rebates. As shown in Table 5 , Medicaid managed care rebates increased substantially since 2011. Table 6 displays FY2013 Medicaid FFS outpatient drug expenditures and total rebates for each state and all states. In FY2013, total Medicaid FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures, before rebates, were about $19.8 billion (federal and state shares, Table 6 ). Also in FY2013, states reported collecting approximately $12.4 billion in FFS drug rebates from drug manufacturers which includes approximately $726 million in supplemental rebates not required under federal Medicaid law ( Table 6 ) and $11.7 billion in required rebates. Net FY2013 Medicaid drug expenditures (after all rebates) were approximately $7.4 billion ( Table 7 ). The Table 6 data may overstate Medicaid FFS rebates. ACA increased the basic rebate percentage and extended manufacturers' additional rebate obligations to line extensions. These ACA changes were retroactive to January 1, 2010. Implementation and accounting for the ACA rebate changes may have lagged behind so that states reported rebates attributable to FY2010-FY2012 utilization in the FY2013 CMS financial reports. In addition, beginning in 2010 with the added authority for states to collect rebates on drugs purchased for full-risk Medicaid managed care beneficiaries, there may have been delays in identifying transactions that were subject to the managed care rebate. Table 7 displays the total amount of SRA rebates collected by states for FY1997-FY2013. In FY2013, 42 states collected a total of $726 million in supplemental FFS rebates ($403 million federal share). In FY2013, California accounted for 23% of the reported supplemental rebates (federal and state shares). Some data seem to suggest that Medicaid FFS drug expenditures have decreased dramatically since FY2006, but net spending changes are attributable at least in part to policy changes that have shifted drug spending from Medicaid to Medicare, increased rebates, and shifted drug coverage from FFS to managed care plans. This section discusses recent Medicaid FFS drug expenditures and patterns. In FY1997, states reported total FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures, net of all rebates—federal and state shares—of about $10.2 billion, or 6.3% of total program spending. In FY2005, total FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures, net of all rebates—federal and state shares—were $30.7 billion, accounting for about 10.2% of Medicaid benefit expenditures. By FY2013, net Medicaid FFS outpatient drug expenditures had decreased to about $16.2 billion and accounted for less than 4% of benefit expenditures. Table 8 displays a summary of Medicaid benefit and outpatient prescription drug expenditures for FY1997-FY2013. The variation in prescription drug expenditures and year-to-year percentage changes shown in Table 8 were attributable to a number of factors. Some of these factors are trends affecting the prescription drug industry and health care markets in general, such as the expiration of prescription drug patents sometimes called the patent-cliff and increasing managed care enrollment. Other policy changes attributable to federal law may be more important than industry trends in explaining Medicaid prescription drug expenditure changes. The amendments to Medicaid drug law helped to reduce outpatient Medicaid prescription drug expenditures. Figure 1 displays the recent history of Medicaid FFS outpatient prescription drug expenditures. There are several changes shown in Figure 1 that coincide with implementation of major legislative changes. Prior to MMA, drug expenditures were steadily increasing, rising from approximately $10.2 billion in 1997 to about $30.7 billion in 2005, even though federal and state (but particularly state) rebates also were increasing. In 2006, there was a substantial decrease (of approximately $7.6 billion) in Medicaid drug expenditures to $23.1 billion when dual eligible drug expenditures were moved to Medicare Part D. In 2010, adjusted Medicaid drug expenditures dipped again to $19.7 billion. This change was in part attributable to the fiscal relief provided to states in the form of ARRA's temporary FMAP increase, which reduced state drug expenditures because it was applied to states' phased-down state contribution (PSC) payments. , PSC payments declined from $7.8 billion in FY2009 to $3.8 billion in FY2010. The PSC decrease shifted a portion of prescription drug costs from state and federal Medicaid matching funds to federal economic recovery funding, thus reducing federal and state Medicaid drug expenditures. Although this also increased federal funding, it shifted that funding from Medicaid to another source. Net FFS drug expenditures returned to approximately the FY2009 level in FY2011 after deducting all rebates but adding in the PSC amount that states would have paid for dual eligible drug expenditures to make comparison with earlier periods consistent. In FY2011, the increased rebate percentages and other ACA changes were just beginning to take effect. These changes boosted federal and state rebates, but drug expenditures increased considerably to $23.1 billion from $19.7 billion in FY2010. The FY2011 increase was probably attributable to reporting delays of the ACA's rebate increases. In FY2012 and FY2013, Medicaid outpatient drug expenditures (after rebates and other adjustments) were substantially reduced, falling from about $23.1 billion in FY2011 to about $18.4 billion in FY2012 and $16.2 billion in FY2013. The FY2012 and FY2013 decreases were somewhat due to modest ACA rebate increases and the rapid movement of Medicaid beneficiaries to managed care coverage that included prescription drugs. As previously discussed, these changes did not reduce prescription drug expenditures, but shifted drug expenditures to other reports. However, looking at state Medicaid drug utilization reports, as shown in Table 9 , estimated (unadjusted, before all rebates and PSC) total Medicaid expenditures for FFS and managed care were higher and consistent with historic drug spending patterns. Although Medicaid drug expenditures for both managed care and FFS appear to be close to their historic levels, expenditures did decline between FY2012 and FY2013 in similar ways for both managed care and FFS drug spending. The decrease could be attributable to different data sources as well as the previously mentioned reporting lags and the patent cliff. Additional data from Medicaid financial reports can provide insight into how Medicaid FFS drug expenditures only have changed over time (not managed care). It is possible to estimate a new FFS drug expenditure by aggregating drug expenditures and rebates and by adjusting for the Medicaid drug expenditures that were moved to Medicare Part D. The net FFS drug expenditure data can then be compared with earlier periods (before 2006) to help identify changes. As shown in Table 10 , the net FFS drug spending decrease between FY2012 and FY2013 was primarily due to decreased prescription drug expenditures, rather than increased rebate collections. FY2012 and FY2013 FFS drug expenditures fell by 20% and 12% respectively from the previous year. The FY2012 and FY2013 decreases in Medicaid FFS drug expenditures may have been caused by several factors, including the rapid growth of Medicaid managed care enrollment that included prescription drug coverage. In FY2012 and FY2013, total Medicaid FFS drug rebate collections also decreased. The decrease in FFS drug rebates was due to reduced FFS drug expenditures—fewer drugs purchased translates to lower rebate collections. This section reviews drug expenditure patterns among the major Medicaid eligibility groups in FY2005 and FY2010 (the latest year data were available). Traditionally, the majority of Medicaid expenditures have been concentrated among the elderly and disabled eligibility groups, which account for the fewest beneficiaries. In contrast, the children and family eligibility groups typically account for more individuals and lower expenditures. The drug expenditure data by basis of eligibility (BOE) show how drug utilization patterns have changed since FY2005 with more drug spending for children and adults and less for the aged and disabled eligibility groups. These changes were probably mostly due to the movement of drug coverage for beneficiaries who were dually eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, the outpatient prescription drug benefit that began January 1, 2006. Table 11 displays FFS drug use and average payments by BOE. As shown in Table 11 , in FY2005, about 71% of Medicaid beneficiaries who were eligible because they were elderly had drug expenditures and Medicaid paid on average about $2,943 annually for their drugs. By FY2010, about 45% of Medicaid beneficiaries who were eligible because they were elderly had prescription drug expenditures, but Medicaid paid only about $451 annually for their drugs. This dramatic decrease in the number of elderly using drugs and the amount of expenditures for those drugs is mostly attributable to the MMA change that shifted outpatient drug coverage for dual eligibles, a group that typically has high drug utilization and costs, to Medicare Part D. However, even though drug costs for dual eligibles were shifted to Medicare Part D, states continued to pay the vast majority of these costs through the phased-down state contribution. Thus, the data shown in Table 11 include dual eligibles' outpatient prescription drug costs in FY2005 but do not include these expenditures in FY2010. Table 11 also shows that children had the lowest average spending and that blind or disabled enrollees had the highest. Among blind or disabled enrollees with prescription drug spending, the average amount was about $3,793 in FY2005 but had declined to about $2,692 in FY2010. For children with prescription drug spending, the average annual amount paid for drugs was about $323 in FY2005 and $379 in FY2010. Even though these data exclude expenditures for dual eligible and Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans, they provide a glimpse of the FFS spending among different eligibility groups. Among all Medicaid beneficiaries who were dispensed drugs in FY2005, the average annual Medicaid prescription drug spending was about $1,509. By FY2010, average per beneficiary annual expenditures had declined to about $926. Again, this decrease probably was due to the following combination of factors: the movement of dual eligible drug coverage from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, other Medicaid drug pricing changes, the increased availability of a number of commonly prescribed drugs as generic rather than brand-name drugs, and other trends affecting prescription drugs. Table 12 displays a summary of the number of prescriptions filled for different drug types—single source, innovator, and non-innovator multiple source drugs—and the total amount states reported reimbursing providers for these drugs. The mix of drugs prescribed by state Medicaid programs affects FFS drug expenditures, with single source drugs representing a higher cost than both innovator and non-innovator multiple source drugs. As Table 12 shows, Medicaid agencies reported processing more than 323.5 million prescription claims in FY2012 and the national average Medicaid FFS payment was about $72. The national data shown in Table 12 are available for each state in Appendix A and Appendix B , which show that in FY2012 average state per prescription payment for all drug categories, before rebates, ranged from a high of about $131 in Colorado to a low of about $35 in Nevada. Table 12 shows that the FY2012 average payment for single source prescription claims was $282 and about $18 for each generic prescription. Similar to Table 12 , Table 13 displays the number of Medicaid FFS drug claims for FY2011 and FY2012, but also shows the percentage of claims of the total that were attributable to each drug category. From FY2011 to FY2012 the percentage of claims attributable to single source products declined from about 19% to about 16% and the percentage of non-innovator multiple source prescription claims increased from about 72% to 75%. During that period (FY2011-FY2012), the overall total volume of FFS claims declined by approximately 17% from about 389 million to 324 million claims. The decline in the overall volume of FFS prescriptions is probably due to states rapidly shifting beneficiaries into managed care plans that provide prescription drug coverage under their capitated rates, rather than through carved out FFS arrangements. The increase in the percentage of claims for generic versus brand products is probably due to the patent cliff. Also similar to Table 12 , Table 14 displays FY2011 and FY2012 Medicaid FFS drug expenditures by drug category drug expenditures, but also shows the percentage of total annual FFS drug expenditures attributable to the different drug categories. As shown in Table 14 , national total Medicaid FFS drug expenditures, before rebates, decreased by about 18% from $28.4 billion to about $23.2 billion from FY2011 to FY2012. However, expenditures for single source Medicaid FFS drugs declined, but expenditures for multiple source non-innovator drugs increased. Table 13 and Table 14 together show that single source drug expenditures represent the majority of Medicaid FFS drug expenditures, accounting for more than 60% of Medicaid FFS drug spending in both FY2011 and FY2012, even though single source drugs accounted for less than 20% of total drug claims in those years. These data are before rebates. If rebates were deducted, the differences between the percentage of expenditures for single source and multiple source drugs might be closer because single source drug rebates are considerably more than rebates for multiple source drugs. CBO estimated that Medicaid's 2010 basic and additional rebate on single source drugs averaged 57% of manufacturers' average prices. Medicaid law permits states to use other techniques in addition to FULs and formularies to help monitor and control overall drug expenditures and utilization. Some techniques to control drug spending involve encouraging the use of lower cost, but generically or therapeutically equivalent products, and other techniques involve establishing limits that encourage appropriate utilization. The discussion in this section is primarily applicable to the administration of Medicaid FFS drug benefits, but policies to help control drug spending are widely used by all insurers that provide prescription drug coverage, including the private sector and managed care plans under contract to state Medicaid programs. All states use all or most of these policies in some form, although there is considerable variation in the degree to which states use these policies. For instance, all states have prior authorization, but many states only require prior authorization for certain drugs. In addition, some states allow managed care plans to establish their own prior authorization procedures and policies. One common cost and utilization process is prior authorization and the use of preferred drug lists (PDLs). PDLs identify pharmaceutical products that have been approved in advance by a committee because they were determined to be clinically effective, but lower cost than other alternative products. Providers may readily prescribe these products to Medicaid beneficiaries. Other non-PDL drugs also are covered but may only be available when they are specifically requested and approved or authorized by the Medicaid agency. Non-PDL drugs must be prior authorized or approved. When providers want to prescribe non-PDL drugs to beneficiaries, the providers (either the physician or the pharmacist) must request permission from the state Medicaid program or the program's contractor to dispense the drug. States may establish prior authorization programs under Medicaid for all drugs or for certain classes of drugs, as long as these programs meet the following two criteria: 1. they must respond within 24 hours to a request for approval, and 2. they must dispense at least a 72-hour supply of a covered drug in emergency situations without prior authorization. States also may restrict the quantity of prescription drugs available to beneficiaries. Such prescribing and dispensing limits are common. The most prevalent constraint is on the drug quantity that may be dispensed for each prescription. A number of states routinely limit the amount of certain drugs dispensed to a 30-day to 34-day supply. In addition, states also sometimes limit the number of prescriptions a beneficiary can have without special approval, particularly for single source products. In 2010, 14 states limited the total number of prescriptions (single and multiple source) per beneficiary and four states capped the monthly number of prescriptions per beneficiary. The remaining 32 states, which accounted for about 40% of Medicaid's 2010 FFS drug expenditures, did not cap the number of monthly prescriptions. All states use policies to control the use of outpatient prescription drugs, and all have programs in place to assess the quality of their pharmaceutical programs. OBRA1990 required states to establish drug use review (DUR) programs by January 1993 and provided temporary enhanced federal matching payment for DUR program start-up costs. In general, DUR programs are aimed at both improving the quality of pharmaceutical care and assisting in cost containment. Selected major DUR program design features include the following: pharmacists and physicians education in identification of fraud, abuse, gross overuse, or inappropriate or medically unnecessary care; enhanced communication between pharmacists and beneficiaries; educational outreach for pharmacists, physicians, and beneficiaries; and pharmacy counseling. States are required to modify their Medicaid state plans to include both prospective and retrospective drug review. Prospective review is provided to beneficiaries before drugs are dispensed, whereas retrospective review is conducted after the sale on drug claims and other data using information technology. States also are required to establish DUR boards that include appropriate health care professionals with knowledge and expertise in outpatient prescription drug prescribing, dispensing, monitoring, DUR, education, intervention, and medical quality assurance. DUR boards must include physicians and pharmacists. States are required to submit an annual DUR report to the Secretary that includes information on DUR board activity as well as on state outpatient prescription drug utilization. CMS is required to evaluate the effectiveness of each state's DUR program. Most state DUR programs are operated by vendors, and these vendors also often overlap with state fiscal agents. Based on state DUR reports, the national average generic prescribing rate was about 74% in FY2011 and about 76% in FY2012. Table D-1 displays a summary of state generic prescribing rates for FY2011 and FY2012. In addition to prior authorization and utilization review, many state Medicaid programs impose beneficiary cost-sharing to help control drug use and spending. Federal Medicaid law permits states to require beneficiaries to pay out of pocket costs to encourage the most cost-effective prescription drug use. To encourage the use of lower-cost drugs, states may establish different generic versus brand-name copayments for drugs included on a PDL. For people with incomes above 150% of FPL, copayments for non-preferred drugs may be as high as 20% of what Medicaid paid for the drug's ingredients. For people with income at or below 150% of FPL, copayments are limited to nominal amounts. State Medicaid programs must specify which drugs are preferred or non-preferred. States also have the option to establish different copayments for mail-order drugs than for those sold in pharmacies. DRA amended the SSA to permit increased Medicaid prescription drug cost-sharing for Medicaid beneficiaries. Prior to DRA, most FFS cost-sharing was limited to \"nominal\" copayments. DRA established two additional cost-sharing options for states. The first option allows states to establish cost-sharing that exceeds nominal amounts and to vary the cost-sharing among beneficiary classes and groups or by service types. The second option, which applies specifically to outpatient prescription drugs, allows states to require beneficiaries to pay higher copayments for state-identified non-preferred drugs and no, or reduced, copayments for preferred drugs. Table 15 displays the maximum copayments states may charge for preferred and non-preferred drugs. The two cost-sharing options come with additional limitations. Besides the specifically exempted groups, cost-sharing cannot exceed 10% of the cost of the item or service for individuals with income between 100% of FPL and 150% of FPL and 20% of the cost of the item or service for individuals with an income over 150% of FPL. Annual aggregate cost-sharing for all Medicaid benefits cannot exceed 5% of family income. Medicaid beneficiaries can be denied services for non-payment of alternative cost-sharing. Some states manage drug costs through the use of PBMs. Many private insurers, including those that provide coverage to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), contract with PBMs for drug benefits management and claims payment. PBMs enable insurers to obtain discounts for pharmaceuticals that would not otherwise be available to single insurers because the PBMs administer multiple insurers' covered populations. In addition, PBMs sometimes provide administrative services intended to improve quality and control costs, such as retail pharmacy network development, mail-order pharmacy operation, formulary development, manufacturer rebate negotiation, and prescription checks for adverse drug interactions. PBMs administer a substantial portion of private health insurance prescription drug benefits and are employed by some states to administer Medicaid drug benefits, often through managed care arrangements. The Medicaid rebate program was authorized by Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90, P.L. 101-508 ), then amended in 1992 by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 ( P.L. 102-585 ). After 1992, there were few federal statutory changes to Medicaid prescription drug pricing until 2003, when the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) was passed. MMA was the first of five laws that reshaped Medicaid drug pricing policy. These changes had a number of goals, such as increasing the amount of rebates collected by states and the federal government and strengthening the ability of states and federal policy makers to monitor and enforce compliance. A number of recent changes were made to improve or revise earlier amendments that did not achieve the desired results. Prescription drug policies are complicated in part because it is hard to isolate the effects of changes in a dynamic market with many private purchasers and sellers. For Medicaid, prescription drug rebates and pricing changes are further complicated because each state has some discretion in how changes are implemented and enforced. This section provides a discussion of major legislative changes to Medicaid prescription drug pricing and rebates. Table 16 displays a summary of major laws with Medicaid drug pricing provisions. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA90, P.L. 101-508 ) established the Medicaid drug rebate program, which assured Medicaid programs would receive the best price. OBRA90 required drug manufacturers that wanted to sell their drugs to Medicaid enrollees to enter into rebate agreements with the Secretary on behalf of the states. Under the agreements, pharmaceutical manufacturers must provide Medicaid programs with rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries. Under the terms of the rebate agreements, manufacturers had to give state Medicaid agencies either their best price or a rebate. After OBRA90 was passed, federal law enabled Medicaid agencies and the federal government to purchase prescription drugs at the lowest market price (best price). An unintended consequence was that certain public health programs, the Department of Veteran's Health Affairs (VHA), the Department of Defense (DOD), and the Public Health Service (PHS) faced sharply higher drug prices. Because Medicaid best price requirements, if pharmaceutical companies gave the DOD, VHA, and PHS providers lower prices, then drug companies would be obligated to sell those products to Medicaid at that same lowest price. Although the percentages of drug manufacturer sales to DOD, PHS programs, and VHA were small, Medicaid accounted for about 12% overall drug sales. Thus, after 1990, when the Medicaid best price provision was implemented, drug manufacturers substantially increased prices to DOD, VHA, and PHS providers. Congress corrected the oversight by passing the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA, P.L. 102-585 ). VHCA amended the SSA to exclude certain sales at nominal prices from the Medicaid best price determination and the Medicaid rebate calculation. Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA, P.L. 108-173 ) implemented many prescription drug and other Medicare program changes, but the most far-reaching was the addition of the voluntary outpatient prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, Part D. MMA also had an important Medicaid provision that moved outpatient drug coverage for full benefit dual eligibles from Medicaid to Medicare Part D. Although Medicare Part D assumed coverage and payment for dual eligible beneficiaries, MMA contained a maintenance-of-effort provision that required states to continue to pay the majority of dual eligibles' prescription drug costs. In addition, MMA revised the AMP definition to exclude sales to Medicare Part D drug sponsors (Part D plans) in determining AMP. DRA made a number of changes to Medicaid drug policies. One of these changes was modifying the formula for setting multiple source drug FULs. DRA Section 6001 required the Secretary to use a new formula for multiple source drug FULs beginning January 1, 2007. The new FUL formula was to equal 250% of the AMP of the least costly therapeutic equivalent. AMP was defined under DRA to be the average price paid to the manufacturer by wholesalers for drugs distributed to the retail pharmacy class of trade. Before the new DRA FUL formula could be implemented, two national pharmacy associations filed a complaint challenging the DRA's FUL proposed rule on the ground that the new FULs would generally be below community pharmacies' drug acquisition costs. The court issued a preliminary injunction in December 2007 that prohibited CMS from setting FULs for Medicaid covered generic drugs based on AMP, and from disclosing AMP data except within HHS or to the Department of Justice. The court's 2007 injunction was for an indefinite period and was in place when ACA became law on March 23, 2010, but has since been lifted. CMS lacked authority to use the pre-DRA formula, which expired September 30, 2009, for setting FULs, and CMS also was unable to use the DRA authority because it was prohibited by the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2010 (MIPPA, P.L. 110-275 ). Just before the MIPPA-authority for using pre-DRA FULs expired on September 30, 2009, CMS issued FULs. The FULs in place now were set in September 2009. In addition, DRA made the following changes: reduced the required number of multiple source products rated by the FDA as therapeutic and pharmaceutically equivalent from three to two; required manufacturers to report AMP to HHS; permitted the Secretary to contract for a retail drug price survey that would allow estimation of a nationwide average consumer drug price, net of all discounts and rebates; disclosed AMP to states and the public; revised the AMP definition; and required states to collect and submit data on physician administered drugs. MIPPA Section 203 required the Secretary to use the pre-DRA FUL formula for setting federal multiple source drug reimbursement through September 30, 2009. The pre-DRA FUL formula was in effect prior to December 31, 2006. Under this formula, FULs were set at 150% of published prices for the least costly therapeutic equivalent. In addition, the Secretary was prohibited from making AMP prices publicly available prior to September 30, 2009. American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA, P.L. 111-5 ) Section 5001 temporarily protected states from FMAP decreases and increased federal matching rates for the recession period. ARRA defined the recession period for the FMAP increase as the period that began with the first quarter of FY2009 (October 1, 2008) and ended with the first quarter of FY2011 (December 31, 2010). During the recession period, states were held harmless from FMAP declines and all states received an across-the-board 6.2 percentage point increase. In addition, certain qualifying states received an additional unemployment-related increase. The Secretary determined that state MOE requirements under MMA for dual eligible drug expenditures were subject to the temporary FMAP increase. The ARRA temporary FMAP increase was extended for an additional two quarters (until June 30, 2011) by the Education, Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act (EJMAA, P.L. 111-226 ). Beginning January 1, 2010, with certain exceptions, ACA Section 2501 increased the flat rebate percentage used to calculate Medicaid's basic rebate for single source and innovator multiple source outpatient prescription drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of AMP. The basic rebate percentage for multiple-source, non-innovator, and all other drugs was increased from 11% to 13% of AMP. ACA also required the Secretary to recover the additional funds states received from drug manufacturers from increases in the basic Medicaid rebates. The Secretary is authorized to reduce Medicaid payments to states for the additional prescription drug rebates that resulted from increases in the minimum rebate percentages—the difference between 15.1% of AMP and 23.1% of AMP for single source products and the difference between 11% and 13% for generic products. ACA requires the Secretary to estimate the additional rebate amounts to recover from states based on utilization and other data. In addition, when it is determined that the recovered amount from a state for a previous quarter under-estimated the actual rebate amount (state share) the Secretary is required to make further adjustments to recover the additional rebates from states. These state payment reductions are considered overpayments to the state and offset against states' regular Medicaid draw, similar to other overpayments. They are not subject to reconsideration. Moreover, ACA required drug manufacturers to pay rebates to states on drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries who received care through Medicaid managed care plans, similar to the way rebates are required under previous law for FFS beneficiaries. Medicaid capitation rates paid by states to managed care plans were to be adjusted to include these rebates. Medicaid managed care plans are subject to additional reporting requirements such as submitting data to states on the total number of units of each dose, strength, and package size by National Drug Code (NDC) for each covered outpatient drug. Medicaid managed care plans can use formularies as long as there are exception processes so that excluded drugs are available through a prior authorization process. With certain exceptions, ACA required that additional rebates for new formulations of single source or innovator multiple source drugs, which are referred to as line extensions . Essentially, the additional (inflation) rebates for line extensions products were to be calculated as if the product was the original product. In this way the additional (inflation) rebates is the greater of the basic rebate for new products or the AMP of the new drug multiplied by highest additional (inflation) rebate for any strength of the original product (calculated for each dose and strength of the product). However, ACA limited the total rebate liability for each dosage form and strength of an individual single source or innovator multiple source drug to no more than 100% of that drug's AMP. Other features of the drug rebate program, such as Medicaid's best price requirement, were unchanged by ACA. ACA was amended before it was enacted to clarify that the calculation of the additional rebate for new formulations of existing drugs (line extensions) applied to single source or innovator multiple source drugs only in oral solid dosage forms. ACA Section 2502 required that smoking cessation drugs, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines be removed from Medicaid's excluded drug list. When this provision took effect beginning January 1, 2014, states that covered prescription drugs were required to cover barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and smoking cessation products for most Medicaid beneficiaries. ACA Section 2503 amended Medicaid law to require the Secretary to establish multiple source drug FULs at 175% or more of the weighted average (determined on the basis of utilization) of the most recently reported monthly AMPs. ACA restored the pre-DRA definition of multiple source drugs as at least three therapeutic and pharmaceutically equivalent products. ACA also included technical changes to the FUL formula, such as a smoothing process to reduce short-term volatility, and clarified that AMP excludes the following: customary prompt pay discounts to wholesalers; bona fide service fees paid by manufacturers to wholesalers and RCPs, such as distribution service fees, inventory management fees, product stocking allowances, and administrative services agreements and patient care programs (medication compliance and patient education programs); reimbursement by manufacturers for recalled, damaged, expired, or unsaleable returned goods; and payments received from, and rebates or discounts to, large purchasers such as PBMs, managed care plans, health maintenance organizations, insurers, hospitals, clinics, mail-order pharmacies, long-term care providers, manufacturers, or any other entity that does not conduct business as a wholesaler or a RCP. ACA Section 2503 modified the AMP definition further by replacing the retail class of trade terminology with RCPs. This change excluded from drug manufacturers' AMP calculation sales to many non-traditional retail outlets, such as mail order, nursing homes, LTC pharmacies, and PBMs. Excluding drug sales through these outlets from the AMP calculation had the effect of raising AMP, thus increasing Medicaid rebates. Moreover, ACA revised the definition of a multiple source drug from one marketed in a state during the rebate period to a product marketed or sold during the rebate period in the United States. ACA expanded drug pricing disclosure requirements to include monthly weighted average AMPs and retail survey prices. Manufacturers are required to report within 30 days of the end of each month of a rebate period the total number of units sold and used by the manufacturer to calculate the AMP for each covered outpatient drug. EJMAA Section 202 amended ACA to include in AMP sales of 5i drugs that generally are not dispensed through retail community pharmacies. This amendment was a technical change to ACA that was made to ensure that AMPs could be calculated and Medicaid rebates could be collected from manufacturers for the 5i drugs even though these products are not typically sold by RCPs. This section discusses the following two Medicaid prescription drug issues: (1) new drug prices and (2) the pending final rule implementing ACA changes. The rising cost of new drugs has been an issue in the past and recently has re-emerged with many groups discussing why drug prices are so high and what can be done to control new drug prices. After a period of relatively few new drugs coming to market, drug manufacturers' pipelines are filling and there could be a surge in new drugs coming to market. Many of the new drugs will be biologic products and some or many of these products will be costly. As a result, concern about rising drugs prices might only be beginning. This section briefly discusses the process for setting new drug prices and then discusses Sovaldi, a new drug launched in 2014, and how Medicaid drug pricing will affect Sovaldi and possibly other new drugs. When drug manufacturers launch new single source drug products, they determine a product's price and generally are not subject to statutory or regulatory limits in setting drug prices. In 2013, FDA approved 27 new molecular entities; in 2012, it approved 39. A number of these newly introduced drugs are expensive, and potentially many more are anticipated. And higher initial prices do not preclude manufacturers from raising prices further after the drugs are launched. Many organizations, patient groups, Members of Congress, insurers, and individuals are concerned about prescription drug costs. Even going back to the 1990s, when costly antiviral drugs were introduced to treat human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), there was considerable concern in Medicaid programs about states' ability to pay for these new drugs. In 2009, GAO published a report that found that drug manufacturers substantially increased prices for certain brand-name drugs from 2000 to 2008. GAO attributed the extraordinary price increases to a number of factors, including lack of good therapeutic alternatives, industry consolidation, and unusual events such as key ingredient supply and manufacturing disruptions. Recently, the topic of excessive new drug costs reemerged accompanying the launch of a new, more effective drug for treating hepatitis C virus (HCV), a liver infection. Pharmaceutical manufacturer Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Gilead) received FDA approval to market Sofobuvir under the brand-name Sovaldi in December 2013 for the treatment of chronic HCV infection. Sovaldi's reported list price is approximately $84,000 for a standard 12-week treatment. Patients can require up to 24 weeks of treatment, and it is usually taken in combination with other drugs, pushing the price above $160,000. In October 2014, the FDA approved a second Gilead drug for treating HCV infections, Ledipasvir/Sofosbuvir, marketed under the brand-name Harvoni ® . Gilead set Harvoni's price at approximately $1,125 per pill, which would result in a cost of about $95,000 for a 12-week treatment course. Gilead's new HCV drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, are unquestionably expensive, but other. However, the Sovaldi product launch may differ from the launch of other drugs for the following reasons: shortage of good therapeutic alternatives, increased awareness of HCV prevalence, improved screening, and, in anticipation of Sovaldi's launch, a backlog of HCV positive individuals who needed treatment. Because many other new drugs, such as cancer drugs, replace an existing product, new cases are diagnosed gradually and a backlog of cases is unusual. With Sovaldi, many cases were already diagnosed, so there may have been considerable pent-up treatment demand. This surge for HCV treatment put added financial pressure on all payers but proved particularly heavy for Medicaid and Medicare, which cover many HCV positive individuals and differ from the more gradual financial effect of other expensive drugs that recently have come to market. In addition, the timing of Sovaldi's FDA approval and introduction might have contributed to the financial hardship Sovaldi is creating for Medicaid. Sovaldi was approved by the FDA in early December 2013. Because Sovaldi was approved as a breakthrough drug it received fast-track review, which shortened the review time and left less time for payers to become aware of the drug and make contract adjustments or otherwise plan for increased costs. Although December is within the federal fiscal year's first quarter, it is very late in the planning cycle for most health insurance contracts, which follow a calendar year. Medicaid managed care plans, Medicare Part D drug plans, and Medicare Part C plans may have been caught off guard by Sovaldi's early December launch. Moreover, state budgets that would provide state Medicaid matching funds for drugs purchased for Medicaid FFS beneficiaries were well past the budget planning cycle for the current state fiscal year. Medicaid programs cover Sovaldi, and as an entitlement the program would need to find fiscal resources whether or not the state had considered the cost when preparing the state's Medicaid budget estimate. Public health care programs, particularly Medicaid, might be more vulnerable to high prices for new drugs than private payers because cost-sharing generally is nominal and coverage is broad, but all payers experience additional costs. Members of Congress have raised concerns about the effect of these new drug treatments on federal and state budgets and the process drug makers use in setting new drug prices. Medicaid and other private organizations have raised similar concerns about Sovaldi's cost to both federal and state governments. In addition to concerns about Sovaldi, private insurers and professional associations have noted the financial impact of high drug prices in general. Gilead participates in the Medicaid rebate program, so Sovaldi is a covered drug. Similar to established single source drugs, Medicaid agencies that purchase Sovaldi for covered FFS beneficiaries will receive the basic Medicaid rebate for their drug purchases, which is the greater of the drug's best price minus AMP or 23.1% of the product's AMP. The rebate is split between the federal government and states based on the FMAP rate for part of the rebate, and the remainder goes the federal government. As a new product, Gilead will report Sovaldi's base-period AMP on the basis of sales from the first full calendar quarter after the launch date. Also, Gilead will not owe additional Medicaid (inflation) rebates because Sovaldi is new and will not have had price increases greater than inflation until at least after the base-period AMP is established. If, or when, Sovaldi's price increases faster than its base-period AMP adjusted for inflation, then Gilead will owe an additional rebate. The additional rebate also is shared by federal and state governments. When Sovaldi is provided to Medicaid beneficiaries by managed care plans, Gilead would be obligated to pay the basic rebate for those purchases, and the additional Medicaid rebate would be applicable if or when Gilead raised prices faster the inflation adjusted base-period AMP. In the short term, Medicaid rebates will help to offset some of the initial cost of treating HCV-positive Medicaid beneficiaries, but Medicaid programs anticipate substantial budget effects. In the longer-term, Medicaid's cost for Sovaldi may decrease through competition from other new therapeutically equivalent products. Other drug makers have new drugs in late-stage development that have shown promise in treating HCV. If some of these other new drugs are approved, Medicaid programs will be able to negotiate with all drug manufacturers that offer HCV products to get better deals on HCV drugs. In FFS Medicaid, when competing products come to market state programs may be able to negotiate SRAs for therapeutically comparable products by offering to list one company's drug on the state PDL, essentially guaranteeing that company most sales for HVC drugs. Medicaid managed care plans also may be able to negotiate discounts when competing products come to market, either individually or through PBMs. In addition, in some situations, individual and combined multi-state purchasing pools can further increase states' leverage in negotiating additional manufacturer price concessions. Once competition is available, even though other manufacturers may price their drugs comparably to Sovaldi, Medicaid programs will be able to use PDLs and other techniques to help reduce their Sovaldi expenditures. Even before competition from other products is available, states may limit access to Sovaldi by requiring that it be used only in limited situations, such as when a beneficiary is free from drug use or when they have advanced disease. Gilead's process for determining the launch price for Sovaldi is not public information. In setting prices, drug manufacturers may consider the costs their new products would offset. Would a chemotherapy drug extend a patient's life a few months or potentially cure the cancer? Would the drug diminish the likelihood of the need for surgery or, in Sovaldi's case, the need for liver transplants in some cases? If the need for liver transplants were significantly reduced, an expensive, even very expensive, drug might save the health system considerable money. Some drug industry executives attribute high drug prices to how the health care industry pays for services and supplies rather than to drug companies attempting to maximize revenue and profit. Medicaid's drug pricing policies might also contribute to new drug price escalation, particularly for a drug such as Sovaldi that potentially will treat many Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid's two-tiered rebate, with a basic rebate and an additional inflation rebate, might indirectly encourage manufacturers to set higher launch prices to offset or recover the cost of Medicaid rebates by reducing the Medicaid inflation rebate. For a drug like Sovaldi, for which there is little therapeutic competition and there may be some or considerable pent up demand, a high launch price that builds in some future period price increases might reduce a manufacturer's additional rebate obligations. At launch, the manufacturer has the market to itself. If it did not raise prices, or raised prices modestly, the manufacturer would avoid most or all of Medicaid's additional inflation rebate. As the backlog of cases decreased and other new drugs came to market, competition would increase and Sovaldi might have to make price concessions to maintain its market position. At that point, Gilead might begin to raise prices much faster, which would provide negotiation room for making price concessions to states through supplemental rebates without reducing profit margins. If the drug manufacturer had not raised Sovaldi's price much while it did not have competition, when new substitute drugs came to market Gilead would have built up some room in its price for Sovaldi for inflation adjustments that it could use before triggering the inflation rebate. Whether or not drug makers are concerned about recovering Medicaid's inflation rebate or some of all Medicaid rebates is unclear, but a high launch price when there are few competing products may carry few risks for drug manufacturers. CMS published an extensive Medicaid drug rebate (MDR) program proposed rule in February 2012 that offered regulatory guidance on the implementation of ACA's Medicaid prescription drug changes. A final rule is pending but anticipated in 2015. Overall, the proposed rule offers substantial guidance to manufacturers and Medicaid programs on how CMS planned to interpret ACA's statutory changes. CMS sought industry comment on a number of issues, so it is unclear how closely a final rule will follow the proposed rule's guidance. The rule proposed modifying the Code of Federal Regulations sections to implement the Medicaid drug changes required in ACA Sections 2501, 2503, 3301, 1101, and 1206. Table 17 identifies regulations that CMS proposed to modify or create in implementing the ACA changes. In the proposed rule, CMS requested comments from industry on a number of issues. CMS proposed to clarify its existing guidance on a number of issues, such as the definitions section. Many of the proposed changes were intended to clarify existing rules to enhance consistency among drug manufacturers and Medicaid programs. Other proposed changes sought to more closely align CMS's policy with existing FDA drug guidance. CMS also proposed substantial changes to AMP and best price that were aimed at assisting manufacturers in computing and reporting these prices consistently. Although the proposed rule changes were extensive, only the following three new sections were added to the CFR subpart: Identification of 5i Drugs (42 CFR §§447.504(d) and 447.507), Medicaid Drug Rebate (42 CFR §447.509), and Requirements for States (42 CFR §447.511). A potential major change would be the inclusion of territories as states, which would require territory Medicaid programs to comply with all the state MDR program requirements. CMS estimated that states and the federal government would save $17.7 billion over five years from implementation of the proposed changes ($13.7 billion to the federal government and $4 billion to the states). CMS also estimated that drug manufacturers, states, and managed care plans would incur about $81.4 million in costs over the period FY2010-FY2012 in implementing the changes. In general, FFS rebates have been effective in helping to control Medicaid FFS drug expenditures. Overall, FFS outpatient drug expenditures have decreased and Medicaid is able to buy drugs for lower prices than Medicare Part D plans and most other federal programs. Congress has been instrumental in establishing Medicaid drug authority to ensure Medicaid pays some of the lowest prescription drug prices. Congress authorized creation of the infrastructure to manage, monitor, and enforce prescription drug pricing. Congress also extended authority for Medicaid to receive rebates on drugs provided to beneficiaries in managed care, and this has resulted in the rapid movement of prescription drug coverage from FFS Medicaid to Medicaid managed care. The percentage of FFS prescription drug claims has fallen from approximately 10% in 2010 to less than 50% in 2013. The movement of prescription drug coverage from FFS to managed care plans could make oversight of the Medicaid prescription drug benefit more difficult. States will be able to collect rebates under managed care contracts, although it is unclear how state supplemental rebates will align with managed care plan (or, more likely, PBM) negotiations with drug wholesalers and manufacturers. Under managed care contracts, states generally delegate some or all DUR and program integrity oversight to managed care plans. Will states be able to conduct DUR and appropriate monitoring comparable to FFS drug benefits? If states and the federal government already procure drugs at some of the best prices, will it be possible for managed care plans and their subcontractor PBMs to reduce costs further? Or will savings come from creating obstacles to beneficiaries receiving covered drugs through utilization controls? Appendix A. FY2012 State FFS Drug Claims Appendix B. FY2012 FFS Drug Paymemt Appendix C. Medicaid FFS Prescription Drug Claims Appendix D. State Generic Prescribing Rates Appendix E. Glossary: Medicaid Drug Terms", "reference": "Medicaid is a federal-state entitlement program that pays for health care and related services on behalf of certain low-income individuals. Prescription drugs are an optional Medicaid benefit and all states cover outpatient drugs. States can create formularies, or lists of preferred drugs, but federal rules tend to result in comprehensive coverage, even for beneficiaries enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans. Pharmaceutical manufacturers that voluntarily participate in Medicaid are required to pay rebates to states on covered outpatient drugs, which help Medicaid receive manufacturers' lowest or best price. States then share the rebate they receive from pharmaceutical manufacturers with the federal government. In determining the amount of rebate, Medicaid law distinguishes between the following two drug types: (1) single source drugs (brand-name drugs) and innovator multiple source drugs (brand-name drugs that now have generic competition); and (2) all other, non-innovator, multiple source (generic) drugs. Rebates for the first category of drugs—drugs still under patent or those once covered by patents—have two components: a basic rebate and an additional rebate. In addition to basic and additional rebates, most states negotiate supplemental rebates with drug manufacturers, by offering to encourage use of a manufacturer's product in exchange for a price concession (rebate). States, through retail pharmacies, purchase drugs on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries. Medicaid pharmacy reimbursement has two components: a payment to cover the cost of the pharmacy buying the drug (ingredient cost) and a payment for the pharmacist's services in filling a prescription (dispensing fee). States set reimbursement for both ingredient costs and dispensing fees. In FY2005, Medicaid fee-for-service (FFS) drug expenditures were approximately $43.1 billion, but by FY2013 had decreased to $19.8 billion. Over the same period, Medicaid FFS drug rebate collections were at about the same level ($12.4 billion), but managed care rebate collections increased substantially to about $4.8 billion in FY2013. The decreases in Medicaid FFS drug expenditures and the increases in rebate collections were mostly offset by at least the following other factors or trends: (1) Beginning January 1, 2006, prescription drug coverage of individuals eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid (dual eligibles) was moved from Medicaid to Medicare Part D, which resulted in substantially reduced Medicaid FFS drug spending. Due to maintenance of effort requirements, state Medicaid programs continue to pay the vast majority of dual eligible drug costs, even though those expenditures are not counted as drug spending. (2) Statutory changes helped to increased rebate collections by extending rebates to Medicaid enrollees covered by managed care plans and increasing the amount of rebates owed by drug companies. (3) The loss of patent protection for a number of commonly prescribed drugs further contributed to decreasing Medicaid drug expenditures. And (4) the rapid shift in enrollment of beneficiaries to managed care plans that cover prescription drugs. In December 2013, Sovaldi®, a new brand-name drug, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of hepatitis virus C (HVC) infections. Sovaldi is estimated to cost $1,000 per pill, and total treatment cost estimates range from $84,000 to more than $168,000. The rebates states and the federal government receive will help reduce Medicaid's Sovaldi expenditures, but until other equivalent drugs are available to increase competition, states may have limited leverage to negotiate additional manufacturer price concessions. Medicaid rebates, however, while buffering the cost of prescription drugs, might also contribute to drug manufacturers setting increasingly higher launch prices. The current Medicaid drug pricing and policy infrastructure was designed for FFS, and may not work as well with significant managed care enrollment. Under managed care contracts, states generally delegate some or all of drug utilization review and individual drug claim oversight to plans, including program integrity. With managed care and pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) responsible for these activities, states have responsibility for ensuring plans uphold their contract obligations. States' prescription drug monitoring is tailored to FFS drug claims. It is unclear how much oversight of managed care claims states will be able to provide. If states and the federal government currently procure drugs for Medicaid beneficiaries at some of the lowest prices, will it be possible for managed care plans to further reduce costs without imposing barriers to Medicaid beneficiaries in obtaining covered drugs?", "prediction": "In exchange for receiving the best price, Medicaid programs must cover all drugs marketed by those manufacturers with certain exceptions. Prior to ACA, drug manufacturers were not required to pay rebates on drugs purchased for Medicaid beneficiaries by managed care plans. In general, FFS rebates have been effective in helping to control Medicaid FFS drug expenditures."}
{"index": 7, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Waste discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants into inland and coastal waters are a significant source of water quality problems throughout the country. Pollutants associated with municipal discharges include nutrients (which can stimulate growth of algae that can deplete dissolved oxygen or produce harmful toxins), bacteria and other pathogens (which may impair drinking water supplies and recreation uses), and metals and toxic chemicals from industrial and commercial activities and households. The collection and treatment of wastewater remains among the most important public health interventions in human history and has contributed to a significant decrease in waterborne diseases during the past century. Funding these systems continues to be of interest to federal, state, and local officials and the general public. The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes performance levels to be attained by municipal sewage treatment plants in order to prevent the discharge of harmful quantities of waste into surface waters and to ensure that residual sewage sludge meets environmental quality standards. It requires secondary treatment of sewage (equivalent to removing 85% of raw wastes), or treatment more stringent than secondary, where needed to achieve water quality standards necessary for recreational and other uses of a river, stream, or lake. Although the nation has made considerable progress in controlling and reducing certain kinds of chemical pollution of rivers since the 1972 CWA amendments, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and others argue that continued infrastructure improvements are necessary to maintain and expand these achievements. The total population served by sewage treatment plants that provide a minimum of secondary treatment increased from 85 million in 1972 to 234 million in 2012, representing 74% of the U.S. population at that time. About four million people are served by facilities that provide less than secondary treatment, but, according to EPA, these facilities have CWA conditional waivers from the secondary treatment requirement. About 21% of households are served by on-site septic systems, not by centralized municipal treatment facilities. Despite improvements, other water quality problems related to municipalities remain to be addressed. A key concern is \"wet weather\" pollution: overflows from combined sewers (sewers that carry sanitary and industrial wastewater, groundwater infiltration, and stormwater runoff that may discharge untreated wastes into streams) and sanitary sewers (sewers that carry only sanitary waste). Untreated discharges from these sewers, which typically occur during rainfall events, can cause serious public health and environmental problems, yet costs to control wet weather problems are high in many cases. In addition, toxic wastes discharged from industries and households to sewage treatment plants cause water quality impairments, operational upsets, and contamination of sewage sludge. Although Congress has provided more than $104 billion in CWA assistance since 1972, funding needs for wastewater infrastructure remain high. According to the most recent estimate by EPA and the states, the nation's wastewater treatment facilities will need $271 billion over the next 20 years to meet the CWA's water quality objectives. This estimate includes $197 billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems, which represent 73% of all needs; $48 billion for combined sewer overflow corrections; $19 billion for stormwater management; and $6 billion to build systems to distribute recycled water. These estimates do not include potential costs, largely unknown, to upgrade physical protection of wastewater facilities against possible terrorist attacks that could threaten water infrastructure systems, an issue of significant interest since September 11, 2001. Needs for small communities represent about 12% of the total. The largest needs in small communities are for new conveyance systems (e.g., pipes), secondary treatment, system repair, and advanced treatment. Five states—New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Texas, and Alabama—accounted for 30% of the small community needs. In addition to prescribing municipal treatment requirements, the CWA authorizes the principal federal program to support wastewater treatment plant construction and related eligible activities. Congress established this program in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972 (P.L. 92-500), significantly enhancing what had previously been a modest grant program. Since then, Congress has appropriated approximately $104 billion to support compliance with the act and achievement of the overall objectives of the act: restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the nation's waters. Title II of P.L. 92-500 authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction under a program administered by EPA. Federal funds were provided through annual appropriations under a state-by-state allocation formula contained in the act. The formula (which has been modified several times since 1972) was based on states' financial needs for treatment plant construction and population. States used their allotments to make grants to cities to build or upgrade categories of wastewater treatment projects, including treatment plants, related interceptor sewers, correction of infiltration/inflow of sewer lines, and sewer rehabilitation. Amendments enacted in 1987 ( P.L. 100-4 ) initiated a new program to support, or capitalize, Clean Water State Revolving Funds (CWSRFs). States continue to receive federal grants, but now they provide a 20% match and use the combined funds to make loans to communities. Monies used for construction are repaid to states to create a \"revolving\" source of assistance for other communities. In FY1989 and FY1990, Congress provided appropriations for both the Title II and Title VI programs. The CWSRF program fully replaced the Title II program in FY1991. However, during the transition from Title II to Title VI, Congress began to provide earmarked water infrastructure grants to individual communities and regions. In subsequent years, the earmarked funds accounted for a significant amount of the total appropriation. General opposition to congressional earmarking stopped the practice in FY2011. Special project appropriations since that time have supported Alaska Native Village and U.S.-Mexico Border projects. Federal contributions to CWSRFs were intended to assist a transition to full state and local financing by FY1995. CWSRFs were to be sustained through repayment of loans made from the fund after that date. The intention was that states would have greater flexibility to set priorities and administer funding in exchange for an end to federal aid after 1994, when the original CWA authorizations expired. However, although most states believe that the CWSRF is working well today, early funding and administrative problems plus remaining funding needs (discussed below) delayed the anticipated shift to full state responsibility. Congress has continued to appropriate funds to assist wastewater construction activities. Figure 1 illustrates the history of EPA wastewater infrastructure appropriations in both nominal dollars and constant (2018) dollars. The increase in FY2009 is due to a $4.0 billion increase in supplemental funds under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ( P.L. 111-5 ). As the figure indicates, the funding level remained relatively stable during the past seven fiscal years. In both FY2016 and FY2017, Congress provided $1.394 billion for the CWSRF program. However, funding for the CWSRF program increased by about 22% in FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), provided $1.694 billion to the CWSRF program. The CWSRF program represented a major shift in how the nation finances wastewater treatment needs. In contrast to the Title II construction grants program, which provided grants directly to localities, CWSRFs are loan programs. States use their CWSRFs to provide several types of financial assistance to communities, including project construction loans made at or below market interest rates, refinancing of local debt obligations, providing loan guarantees, and purchasing insurance. States may also provide additional loan subsidies (including forgiveness of principal and negative interest loans) in certain instances. Loans are to be repaid to the CWSRF within 30 years beginning within one year after project completion, and the locality must dedicate a revenue stream (from user fees or other sources) to repay the loan to the state. States must agree to use CWSRF monies first to ensure that wastewater treatment facilities are in compliance with deadlines, goals, and requirements of the act. After meeting this \"first use\" requirement, states may also use the funds to support other types of water quality programs specified in the law, such as those dealing with nonpoint source pollution and protection of estuaries. The CWA identifies a number of types of projects and activities as eligible for CWSRF assistance. The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA, P.L. 113-121 ) amended the list by adding several projects and activities. The current list includes wastewater treatment plant construction, stormwater treatment and management, replacement of decentralized treatment systems (e.g., septic tanks), energy-efficiency improvements at treatment works, reuse and recycling of wastewater or stormwater, and security improvements at treatment works. States must also agree to ensure that communities meet several specifications (such as requiring that locally prevailing wages be paid for wastewater treatment plant construction pursuant to the Davis-Bacon Act). In addition, WRRDA amended the CWA to require that CWSRF recipients must use American-made iron and steel products in their projects. As under the previous Title II program, decisions on which projects will receive assistance are made by states using a priority ranking system that typically considers the severity of local water pollution problems, among other factors. States also evaluate financial considerations of the loan agreement (interest rate, repayment schedule, the recipient's dedicated source of repayment) under the CWSRF program. All states have established the legal and procedural mechanisms to administer the loan program and are eligible to receive CWSRF capitalization grants. Some with prior experience using similar financing programs moved quickly. Others had difficulty in making a transition from the previous grants program to one that requires greater financial management expertise for all concerned. More than half of the states currently leverage their funds by using federal capital grants and state matching funds as collateral to borrow in the public bond market for purposes of increasing the pool of available funds for project lending. Cumulatively since 1988, leveraged bonds have comprised about 34% of total CWSRF funds available for projects. Small communities and states with large rural populations have had challenges with the CWSRF funding programs. Many of these communities have limited financial, technical, and legal resources and may encounter difficulties in qualifying for and repaying CWSRF loans. These communities often lack an industrial tax base and thus face the prospect of very high per capita user fees to repay a loan for the full capital cost of sewage treatment projects. Compared with larger cities, many are unable to benefit from economies of scale, which can affect project costs. However, since 1989, 67% of all loans and other assistance (comprising 22% of total funds loaned) have gone to assist towns and cities with populations of less than 10,000. The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) program provides another source of financial assistance for water infrastructure. Congress established the WIFIA program in WRRDA. The act, among other provisions, authorizes EPA to provide credit assistance (e.g., secured/direct loans or loan guarantees) for a range of wastewater and drinking water projects. Project costs must be $20 million or larger to be eligible for credit assistance. In rural areas (defined as populations of 25,000 or less), project costs must be $5 million or more. To fund this five-year pilot program, Congress authorized to be appropriated a total of $1.75 billion from FY2015 through FY2019. In 2016, Congress appropriated the first funds to cover the subsidy cost of the program, providing $20 million to EPA to begin making loans, and allowed the agency to use up to $3 million of the total for administrative purposes. In May 2017, Congress provided an additional $8 million for EPA to apply toward loan subsidy costs and an additional $2 million for EPA's administrative expenses. EPA began accepting loan applications for its WIFIA program in January 2017. EPA received 43 letters of interest from prospective borrowers in the agency's first round of funding solicitation. In aggregate, the prospective borrowers requested $6 billion in WIFIA loans. In July 2017, EPA selected 12 projects to continue the application process. The loan amounts requested for the projects ranged from $22 million to $625 million for a total of $2.3 billion. For FY2018, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 ( P.L. 115-141 ), provided $63 million for the WIFIA program (including $8 million for administrative costs). EPA announced a second round of WIFIA funding on April 4, 2018. EPA estimated that its budget authority ($55 million) would provide approximately $5.5 billion in credit assistance. In addition to the water infrastructure assistance programs discussed above, which are administered by EPA, other federal agencies implement broader programs that may provide assistance for wastewater infrastructure projects. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) operates grant and loan programs for drinking water supply and wastewater facilities in rural areas, defined as areas of not more than 10,000 persons. For FY2018, Congress appropriated $895 million for USDA's rural water and waste disposal grant program and approximately $1.2 billion for direct loan authority. The Department of Housing and Urban Development administers the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program. For FY2018, Congress provided $3.3 billion for these funds. Water and waste disposal projects compete with many other CDBG-funded public activities and have accounted for approximately 10% of total grant disbursements in recent years. The Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) provides project grants for construction of public facilities—including, but not limited to, water and sewer systems—as part of approved overall economic development programs in areas of lagging economic growth. For FY2018, the public works and economic development program is funded at $118 million. The federal government directly funds only a small portion of the nation's annual wastewater treatment capital investment. State and local governments provide the majority of needed funds. Local governments have primary responsibility for wastewater treatment: They own and operate approximately 15,000 treatment plants nationwide. Construction of these facilities has historically been financed with federal grants, state grants to supplement federal aid, and revenue from broad-based local taxes (property tax, retail sales tax, or, in some cases, local income tax). Where grants are unavailable—and especially since CWSRFs were established—local governments often seek financing by issuing bonds and then levying fees or charges on users of public services to repay the bonds in order to cover all or a portion of local capital costs. Almost all such projects are debt-financed (not financed on a pay-as-you-go basis from ongoing revenues to the utility). The principal financing tool that local governments use is issuance of tax-exempt municipal bonds. The vast majority of U.S. water utilities rely on municipal bonds and other debt to some degree to finance capital investments. Shifting the CWA aid program from categorical grants to the CWSRF loan program in 1990 had the practical effect of making localities ultimately responsible for nearly 100% of project costs rather than less than 50% of costs. This has occurred concurrently with other financing challenges—including the need to fund other environmental services, such as drinking water and solid waste management—and increased operating costs. (New facilities with more complex treatment processes are more costly to operate.) Options that localities face, if intergovernmental aid is not available, include raising additional local funds (through bond issuance, increased user fees, developer charges, or general or dedicated taxes), reallocating funds from other local programs, or failing to comply with federal standards. Each option carries with it certain practical, legal, and political problems. Authorizations of appropriations for CWSRF capitalization grants expired in FY1994, making this an issue of congressional interest. Appropriations have continued, as shown in Figure 1 . In the 104 th Congress, the House passed a comprehensive reauthorization bill ( H.R. 961 ), which included CWSRF provisions to address problems that have arisen since 1987, including assistance for small and disadvantaged communities and expansion of projects and activities eligible for CWSRF assistance. However, no legislation was enacted because of controversies over other parts of the bill. One ongoing focus has been on projects needed to control wet weather water pollution (i.e., overflows from combined and separate stormwater sewer systems). The 106 th Congress authorized $1.5 billion of CWA grant funding specifically for wet weather sewerage projects (in P.L. 106-554 ), because under the CWSRF program, wet weather projects compete with other types of eligible projects for available funds. However, authorization for these wet weather project grants expired in FY2003 and has not been renewed. No funds were appropriated. In several Congresses since the 107 th , House and Senate committees have approved bills to extend the act's CWSRF program and increase authorization of appropriations for CWSRF capitalization grants, but no legislation has been enacted until recently. Issues debated in connection with these bills included extending CWSRF assistance to help states and cities meet the estimated funding needs, modifying the program to assist small and economically disadvantaged communities, and enhancing the CWSRF program to address a number of water quality priorities beyond traditional treatment plant construction—particularly the management of wet weather pollutant runoff from numerous sources, which is the leading cause of stream and lake impairment nationally. The 113 th Congress enacted considerable changes to the CWSRF provisions in 2014 ( P.L. 113-121 ). These amendments addressed several issues, including extending loan repayment terms from 20 years to 30 years, expanding the list of CWSRF-eligible projects, increasing assistance to Indian tribes, and imposing \"Buy America\" (iron and steel) requirements on CWSRF recipients. The act also added a new provision that allows CWSRF grants to be used for \"forgiveness of principal\" and \"negative interest loans\" under certain conditions. The 2014 amendments did not address other long-standing or controversial issues, such as authorization of appropriations for CWSRF capitalization grants (which expired in FY1994), state-by-state allocation of capitalization grants, and applicability of prevailing wage requirements under the Davis-Bacon Act (which currently apply to use of CWSRF monies). As discussed above, the 2014 legislation also included provisions authorizing the WIFIA program. In the 114 th Congress, the Senate passed the Water Resources Development Act ( S. 2848 ), which included several provisions involving wastewater funding. For the most part, these provisions were not included in the final version of this legislation, which Congress enacted in December 2016 (Water Infrastructure and Improvements for the Nation Act, P.L. 114-322 ). Although interest in meeting the nation's water infrastructure needs is strong and likely to continue, proposals to provide financial assistance to local communities will compete with other objectives, including deficit reduction. It is uncertain how infrastructure programs will fare in these debates. Legislative proposals introduced in the 115 th Congress that include wastewater infrastructure related provisions are identified in Table 1 below.", "reference": "The collection and treatment of wastewater remains among the most important public health interventions in human history and has contributed to a significant decrease in waterborne diseases during the past century. Nevertheless, waste discharges from municipal sewage treatment plants into rivers and streams, lakes, and estuaries and coastal waters remain a significant source of water quality problems throughout the country. The Clean Water Act (CWA) establishes performance levels to be attained by municipal sewage treatment plants in order to prevent the discharge of harmful wastes into surface waters. The act also provides financial assistance so that communities can construct treatment facilities and related equipment to comply with the law. Although approximately $104 billion in CWA assistance has been provided since 1972, funding needs for wastewater infrastructure remain high. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that the nation's wastewater treatment facilities will need $271 billion over the next 20 years to meet the CWA's water quality objectives. The CWA authorizes the principal federal program to support wastewater treatment plant construction and related eligible activities. Congress established the CWA Title II construction grants program in 1972, significantly enhancing what had previously been a modest grant program. In 1987, Congress amended the CWA and created the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) program. This program represented a major shift in how the nation finances wastewater treatment needs. In contrast to the Title II construction grants program, which provided grants directly to localities, CWSRFs are loan programs. States use their CWSRFs to provide several types of loan assistance to communities, including project construction loans made at or below market interest rates, refinancing of local debt obligations, providing loan guarantees, and purchasing insurance. In 2014, Congress revised the CWSRF program by providing additional loan subsidies (including forgiveness of principal and negative interest loans) in certain instances (P.L. 113-121). In addition, the 2014 act increased the types of projects eligible for CWSRF assistance. In both FY2016 and FY2017, Congress provided $1.394 billion for the CWSRF program. However, funding for the program increased by 22% in FY2018. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-141) provided $1.694 billion to the CWSRF program. In addition, Congress established the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) program in 2014 (P.L. 113-121). WIFIA provides direct loans for an array of water infrastructure projects, including CWSRF-eligible projects. EPA issued its first WIFIA loan in April 2018. In FY2018, Congress appropriated $63 million to EPA for the WIFIA program (roughly double the FY2017 appropriation). EPA estimates that this funding will provide approximately $5.5 billion in credit assistance. Policymakers have continued to propose changes to wastewater infrastructure funding programs. Issues debated in connection with these proposals include extending CWSRF assistance to help states and cities meet the estimated funding needs, modifying the program to assist small and economically disadvantaged communities, and enhancing the CWSRF program to address a number of water quality priorities beyond traditional treatment plant construction—particularly the management of wet weather pollutant runoff from numerous sources, which is the leading cause of stream and lake impairment nationally.", "prediction": "Although Congress has provided more than $104 billion in CWA assistance since 1972, funding needs for wastewater infrastructure remain high. 92-500 authorized grants to states for wastewater treatment plant construction under a program administered by EPA.

{"index": 8, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "The scientific, economic, and political questions surrounding climate change have long been with us. This report focuses instead on a relative newcomer: the legal debate. Though the first court decision related to climate change appeared 19 years ago, the quantity of such litigation has mushroomed in recent years. One observer counts 118 lawsuits and petitions for government action filed on climate change issues through the end of 2008—41 lawsuits filed in 2007 alone. Representatives of some suing organizations and states acknowledge that a prime cause for this litigation surge is the inaction of Congress and the executive branch during the George W. Bush Administration with regard to mandatory constraints on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and their perception that litigation might help to prompt such action. Early signs are that the pace of new filings during the Obama Administration may be tapering off. The principal court cases, decided and pending, arise in eight contexts—a number that continues to grow. First and most important is the Clean Air Act (CAA). In April, 2007, the Supreme Court held in Massachusetts v. EPA that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority under the CAA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles. The second context for climate change litigation is the federal wildlife statutes, raising the issue of whether statutes like the Endangered Species Act can be used to limit GHG emissions based on their contribution to climate-climate-related alterations of wildlife habitat. Third is the federal energy statutes, such as the Energy Policy and Conservation Act and Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which also raise questions as to whether climate change impacts must be considered in their spheres. The fourth context for litigation is federal information statutes such as the National Environmental Policy Act, exploring the extent to which they can be used to compel government analysis of and dissemination of information about climate change. Fifth is common law tort theories such as nuisance and whether they be used successfully by state and private plaintiffs to force cutbacks in GHG emissions, or payment of damages? Sixth is federal preemption of state regulation of GHG emissions. This category breaks down into efforts by states and environmentalists to reverse EPA's refusal to waive Clean Air Act preemption, and auto industry efforts to impose preemption under non-Clean Air Act theories, such as the \"CAFE standards\" under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Seventh, chiefly with respect to coal-fired power plants, is state utilities laws. And eighth is whether general liability insurance policies cover harms and liabilities caused by climate change. Sections I through VIII of this report address these eight areas of litigation in turn. Most known cases, decided and pending, are mentioned—omitted cases are those that raise climate change issues in only the most marginal way or only implicitly, and some state cases. Looking beyond the domestic lawsuits, Section IX surveys international law arguments that might be used to induce GHG emission reductions from the United States and other countries that are major GHG emitters, and the few international law claims filed against the United States to date. Finally, Section X offers overall comments. Aware that prospects for Senate approval of the Kyoto Protocol were dubious, some Members of Congress became concerned in the late 1990s that the Clinton Administration EPA might seek to regulate GHG emissions in the absence of approval, under either of two claimed authorities. One authority would derive from an argument that even prior to ratification, the Protocol provided some sort of legal basis for emissions restrictions, perhaps citing past treaties signed by the United States that were provisionally implemented prior to going into effect. This possibility provoked a series of enactments barring EPA's use of appropriated funds to implement the Kyoto Protocol in the absence of approval and ratification. The rest of this section deals with the second claim of possible authority: regulating GHG emissions independently of the Protocol, under the CAA. This authority has now been confirmed by the Supreme Court, at least as to mobile sources; nonetheless, this report retains from earlier versions the historical evolution of the issue. In 1998, an EPA General Counsel memorandum concluded that CO 2 satisfies the CAA definition of \"air pollutant,\" but that this conclusion is only the first step. Before EPA can regulate CO 2 emissions, the memorandum went on, it must further conclude that CO 2 meets criteria in other CAA provisions requiring the agency to determine that the substance poses harm to public health, welfare, or the environment. This next step EPA declined to take. At a House hearing in 1999, a panel of legal experts argued the question of EPA's authority to regulate CO 2 under the CAA. A new EPA General Counsel endorsed his predecessor's analysis in the 1998 memorandum, but just as his predecessor, stressed that the EPA's legal analysis was \"largely theoretical\" since \"EPA currently has no plans to regulate carbon dioxide....\" This hands-off position was prompted in part by strong congressional opposition based on uncertainties as to the economic impact of regulating a pollutant as widespread as CO 2 . In addition, some in Congress argued that CAA implementation of a CO 2 standard was barred by the aforementioned enactments (appropriation riders) prohibiting implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. The EPA General Counsel opinion that \"air pollutant\" includes GHGs held sway until 2003, when that office reversed itself in the context of a petition asking the agency to regulate GHG emissions from mobile sources. This story picks up below (\"Mobile Sources of GHG Emissions\"). The earliest lawsuit in this category, now dismissed, sought to have EPA promulgate national ambient air quality standards for CO 2 . In Massachusetts v. Whitman , filed in 2003, three Northeast states (MA, CT, ME) sought to force EPA to list CO 2 as a \"criteria pollutant\" under the CAA. They argued that on various occasions, EPA had indicated its belief that CO 2 emissions contribute to climate change. These EPA statements constituted, in the words of CAA section 108, a \"judgment [that GHG emissions] cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare\" and \"result[] from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.\" These prerequisites being satisfied, the suit argued, section 108 requires EPA to add CO 2 to its list of \"criteria pollutants,\" then proceed under section 109 to develop national ambient air quality standards for CO 2 . On September 3, 2003, a few days after EPA's denial of a petition asking the agency to regulate GHG emissions from motor vehicles, the plaintiff states voluntarily dismissed this suit, reportedly so as to transfer their energies to a suit challenging the petition denial (leading to the Supreme Court's Massachusetts v. EPA decision). The remaining suits in this category are all active today. Each one seeks EPA regulation of GHG emissions through new source performance standards (NSPSs) under the CAA. In most of these cases, regulation of GHGs is not the primary issue. Nonetheless, it should be noted that they will be litigated in the shadow of the Supreme Court ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA holding that EPA has authority under the CAA to regulate GHGs from mobile sources. The burning question is how that ruling will affect EPA regulation of stationary-source GHG emissions. The first NSPS suit was New York v. EPA , an effort to compel EPA to issue a NSPS for CO 2 from steam generating units. New York began with an EPA proposal to revise its NSPSs for electric utility and other steam-generating units. Some commenters on the proposed rule argued that EPA must, in addition to the revisions proposed, set NSPSs for GHGs emitted from steam generating units. The commenters pointed to CAA section 111's command that EPA promulgate NSPSs to address emissions from new stationary sources that \"cause[], or contribute[] significantly to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" In promulgating its final rule in February, 2006, however, EPA rejected this demand, saying (it being pre- Massachusetts v. EPA ) that the agency lacked authority to set NSPSs for GHGs. Review of the final rule was sought in the D.C. Circuit. In 2006, the court severed the portion of the case dealing with regulation of GHGs, titling it New York v. EPA . In 2007, a few months after the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA , this severed case was remanded to EPA for further proceedings in light of that decision (this section infra ) . Two other NSPS suits concern oil and natural gas—the production side in one suit; the refining side in the other. As to production, plaintiffs in WildEarth Guardians v. Johnson , No. 1:09 CV 00089 (D.D.C. filed January 14, 2009), invoke the CAA citizen suit provision to force EPA performance of alleged nondiscretionary duties under both the NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants provisions of the act. The complaint notes CO 2 , and particularly methane, as GHG pollutants of concern. Since neither of these pollutants is listed as a hazardous air pollutant, it may be surmised that the sole portion of the lawsuit pertinent to climate change is the NSPS claim. That claim alleges EPA's failure to review and revise the NSPS for the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Production category since 1985, despite the CAA requirement that NSPSs be reviewed, and if appropriate revised, every eight years. As for oil and gas refining, New York and 11 other states (CA, CT, DE, ME, MA, NH, NM, OR, RI, VT, and WA) filed a petition for review in 2008 challenging EPA's revisions that year of its existing NSPS for petroleum refineries. Petitioners' argument in New York v. EPA , No. 08-1279 (D.C. Cir. filed August 25, 2008), is that EPA acted arbitrarily and capriciously in failing to determine whether GHGs from petroleum refineries endanger public health and welfare and by failing to promulgate NSPSs for GHG emissions in the refinery rule. Petitioners cite CAA section 111(b)'s requirement that EPA make an endangerment determination, establish NSPS for a source category that contributes significantly to such endangerment, and revise the NSPS at least every eight years. This lawsuit has been consolidated with several others, including Environmental Integrity Project v. EPA (No. 08-1281), and is now styled American Petroleum Institute v. EPA (No. 08-1277). On December 15, 2008, the D.C. Circuit granted a motion to hold the case in abeyance while EPA considers various petitions for administrative reconsideration of the rule. The most recent NSPS suit, Environmental Integrity Project v. U.S. EPA , No. 1:09-CV 00218 (D.D.C. filed February 4, 2009), seeks to compel EPA to perform its nondiscretionary duty to review, and if necessary revise, its NSPS for nitric acid plants, including for nitrous oxide (N 2 O), a powerful GHG.. The standard, plaintiffs allege, has not been reviewed since 1984, notwithstanding the CAA requirement that NSPSs be reviewed and if appropriate revised every eight years. Rather than seeking general rulemaking directly, as above, the following legal efforts seek to impose CO 2 emission limits in actions against specific proposed facilities—mostly coal-fired power plants. Plainly, of course, the effect of rulings in actions against specific sources can signify a de facto general rule as well. The efforts described here are part of a broader campaign by certain environmental groups to block, or at least limit the GHG emissions of, new coal-fired power plants generally. In Northwest Environmental Defense Center v. Owens Corning Corp ., environmental groups invoke the CAA citizen suit provision to enforce the act's \"new source review\" requirement as to GHG emissions. They contend that Owens Corning is constructing a manufacturing plant in Oregon with the potential to emit more than 250 tons per year of harmful gases, without having obtained the required CAA permit. The principal such gas is HCFC-142b, which plaintiffs contend is a potent GHG. In a preliminary ruling, the court held that plaintiffs have standing, notwithstanding that the climate change impacts of the plant's GHG emissions would be \"indirect.\" Anticipating the Supreme Court's rationale for granting standing in Massachusetts v. EPA , the court found that standing was not precluded by the fact that the injury to plaintiffs would be shared with many others, nor because the relief sought would not lead to a complete elimination of climate change impacts. Several proceedings, chiefly brought by the Sierra Club, have involved administrative appeals to EPA's Environmental Appeals Board of \"new source review\" permits in Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) areas. In each case, the issue has been whether a permit issued for construction of a new \"major emitting facility\" (or major modification of an existing facility) in a PSD area must require \"best available control technology\" (BACT) for CO 2 emissions from that source. The CAA requires such new facilities (or major modifications) to install BACT for \"each pollutant subject to regulation under this Act.\" Thus, the pivotal question has been when —upon the occurrence of what event—do CO 2 and other GHG emissions become \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA. In the first proceeding, In re Christian County Generation, LLC, PSD Appeal No. 07-01, 13 E.A.D. ____ (January 28, 2008), Sierra Club objected to the issuance of a PSD permit by a state agency for construction of a coal-fired electric power plant. The Board denied the petition because Sierra Club had not raised its argument during the public comment period on the draft permit. The second and most publicized case, In re Deseret Power Electric Cooperative , PSD Appeal No. 07-03, 14 E.A.D. _____ (November 13, 2008), involved a PSD permit issued by EPA Region 8 to allow construction of a new waste-coal-fired utility generating unit at an existing power plant located near Bonanza, Utah. The Board rejected Sierra Club's contention that \"subject to regulation\" has a plain meaning compelling Region 8 to impose a CO 2 BACT limit in the PSD permit. Sierra Club had pointed to EPA's 1993 amendment of its regulations requiring monitoring and reporting of CO 2 emissions, as directed by section 821 of the 1990 CAA Amendments. At the same time, the Board rejected the Region's argument that it was limited by an historical agency interpretation to read \"subject to regulation\" as meaning \"subject to a statutory or regulatory provision that requires actual control of emissions of that pollutant.\" Since EPA has yet to issue a CAA regulation requiring actual control of CO 2 emissions, Region 8 argued, BACT for CO 2 is not required. Hence, the Board remanded the permit to the Region for it to reconsider whether to impose a CO 2 BACT limit. The Board recognized, however, that given the significance of the issue, it would be best if the Agency, rather than one of its regional offices, defined \"subject to regulation under this Act.\" This the EPA Administrator did a month later. In a memorandum issued December 18, 2008, he declared EPA's \"definitive interpretation\" of its regulation defining which pollutants trigger new source review in PSD areas. Reprising Region 8's argument in Deseret Power , the Administrator said that this regulation \"exclude[s] pollutants for which EPA regulations only require monitoring or reporting but ... include[s] each pollutant subject to either a provision in the Clean Air Act or regulation adopted by EPA under the Clean Air Act that requires actual control of emissions of that pollutant.\" To reiterate, this position excludes CO 2 until EPA promulgates a regulation covering CO 2 emissions. Sierra Club petitioned for review of the December 18 memorandum, which was granted by the newly arrived Obama Administration on February 17, 2009. In the third EAB appeal, In re Northern Michigan University (Ripley Heating Plant) , PSD Appeal No. 08-02, 14 E.A.D. ______ (February 18, 2009), Sierra Club challenges a permit issued by the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality to the university, allowing it to construct a new circulating fluidized bed boiler at the heating plant. Sierra Club's argument was the same as in Deseret , and the Board ruled identically—that is, it directed the Michigan agency, guided by Deseret , to consider whether \"pollutant subject to regulation\" requires application of a BACT limit to CO 2 emissions. The Board's decision makes no mention of the Administrator's December, 2008 memo or EPA's grant of review thereof in 2009. In yet another EAB appeal of a PSD permit, In re Desert Rock Energy Co., LLC , PSD Appeal No. 08-03 (consolidated with others), challenge was brought by several environmental groups and New Mexico. The EPA Region 9 permit allows construction of a new 1,500-megawatt coal-fired power plant within the Navajo Indian Reservation in New Mexico. In January, 2009, however, Region 9 withdrew for additional analysis the portion of its permit decision on whether to impose CO 2 limitations, leading the EAB on January 22, 2009, to stay further consideration of the issue. Turning from administrative appeals, at least two state courts have been called on to decide whether BACT must be applied to CO 2 in PSD areas. One has ruled. In Friends of the Chattahoochee, Inc. v. Couch , No. 2008CV146398 (Ga. Super. Ct. June 30, 2008), the court vacated and remanded a state ALJ decision upholding a state-issued PSD permit for construction of a 1,200-megawatt coal-fired power plant, proposed by Longleaf Energy Associates, LLC. Even putting aside the argument that after Massachusetts v. EPA , CO 2 is \"subject to regulation\" because it falls within the CAA's definition of \"air pollutant,\" the court had no doubt that CO 2 was \"subject to regulation\" based on the act's mandating of CO 2 monitoring and \"many other examples of Clean Air Act regulations that address CO 2 .\" The BACT requirement, said the court, is not limited to pollutants for which there is a separate, general numerical limitation, such as a national ambient air quality standard under the CAA. The other state court action is pending. In Montana Environmental Information Center v. Montana Department of Environmental Quality , No. DDV 08-820 (Mont. D. Ct. filed June 27, 2008), challenge is made to a state-issued PSD permit for a proposed 250-megawatt coal-fired power plant to be known as the Highwood Generating Station. Consistent with the federal CAA, Montana's PSD regulations require that any new major stationary source apply BACT for each pollutant \"subject to regulation\" under the CAA (and the state CAA). Petitioners argue that the permit should have applied BACT to the proposed plant's CO 2 emissions, since in light of Massachusetts v. EPA and CAA requirements for monitoring and reporting of CO 2 emissions, CO 2 is \"subject to regulation\" under the federal and state acts. In 1999, 19 organizations petitioned EPA to regulate emissions of GHGs (CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons) from new motor vehicles. The rulemaking petition cited the agency's alleged mandatory duty to do so under CAA section 202(a)(1). That section directs the EPA Administrator to prescribe emission standards for \"any air pollutant\" from new motor vehicles \"which, in his judgment cause[s], or contribute[s] to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" In 2003, EPA denied the section 202 petition. Much of the agency's rationale followed a new General Counsel memorandum, issued the same day. Contrary to its Clinton Administration precursor, this new OGC memorandum concluded that the CAA does not grant EPA authority to regulate CO 2 and other GHG emissions for their climate change impacts. EPA's denial of the section 202 petition prompted a suit in the D.C. Circuit by twelve states (CA, CT, IL, MA, ME, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, VT, WA) and others. Opposing the challenge, besides EPA, were ten state intervenors (AK, ID, KS, MI, ND, NE, OH, SD, TX, UT), plus several automobile- and truck-related trade groups. In 2005, a split panel in Massachusetts v. EPA rejected the suit, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari. In Massachusetts v. EPA , the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 for petitioners on all three issues in the case. First, Massachusetts, the majority held, had standing to bring the claim. Second, EPA has authority to regulate motor vehicle GHGs under section 202, since \"air pollutant\" includes GHG emissions. And third, the phrase \"in his judgment\" in section 202 does not allow EPA to exercise discretion against regulating based on policy considerations. The ruling in favor of petitioners was forecast early in the majority opinion by its opening sentences: \"A well-documented rise in global temperatures has coincided with a significant increase in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Respected scientists believe the two trends are related.\" (Nor did the dissenters dispute this.) Most of the decision is devoted to the first issue, standing. The Court found that petitioners had two factors in their favor. First, the CAA specifically authorizes challenges to agency action unlawfully withheld, such as here. A litigant to whom Congress has accorded such a procedural right, said the Court, \"can assert that right without meeting all the normal standards for redressability and immediacy\" —two prerequisites of the standing test. Second, the Court found it \"of considerable relevance\" that the petitioner injury on which it focused—Massachusetts's loss of shore land from global-warming-induced sea level rise—was that of a sovereign state. States are \"not normal litigants for the purposes of invoking federal jurisdiction,\" said the Court, noting their quasi-sovereign duty to preserve their territory. Having described petitioners' favored position in establishing standing, it was surprising that the Court then undertook a traditional standing analysis. As to the first prong of the standing test—whether plaintiff has demonstrated actual or imminent \"injury in fact\" of a concrete and particularized nature—the Court homed in on Massachusetts's status as owner of much of the shore land being lost to sea level rise. That this injury may be widely shared with other coastal states does not disqualify this injury, said the Court; it is nonetheless concrete. The second prong of the standing test is causation, requiring that the injury of which the plaintiff complains is fairly traceable to the defendant. EPA did not dispute the existence of a causal relationship between GHG emissions and climate change. It did argue, however, that any reduction in GHG emissions achieved through the current litigation would be too small a portion of worldwide GHG emissions to make a cognizable difference in climate change. In a ruling that may be of benefit to environmental plaintiffs in many contexts, the Court held that even an agency's refusal to take a \"small incremental step\" that would result in only a modest reduction in worldwide GHG emissions, is enough for standing purposes. The third and final prong of the standing test is redressability, demanding that the remedy sought by the plaintiff is one that is likely to redress his/her injury. Here, the remedy sought was EPA regulation of GHG emissions from new motor vehicles. The Court found that this remedy satisfied redressability because while it would not by itself reverse climate change, it would nonetheless slow or reduce such change. Nor, given the \"enormity\" of the potential effects of climate change, was it relevant to the Court that the full effectiveness of the remedy would be delayed until existing cars and trucks on the road were largely replaced by new ones. In contrast with the Court's lengthy discourse on standing, its handling of the CAA issues in the case is quite brief. On the authority question, the Court said that the CAA's broad definition of \"air pollutant\" simply cannot be squared with EPA's view that GHGs are not included. The Court rejected EPA's argument that federal laws enacted following enactment of this definition—laws emphasizing interagency collaboration and research—suggest that Congress meant to curtail EPA's power to use mandatory regulations in addressing air pollutants. Nor was the Court impressed with EPA's argument that \"air pollutant\" in the CAA could not include vehicle GHG emissions because EPA standards for such emissions could be satisfied only by improving fuel economy, a goal assigned to the Department of Transportation under a different statute (the Energy Policy and Conservation Act ). Finally, on the discretion issue, the majority concluded that \"in his judgment\" refers only to whether an air pollutant \"may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\" Thus, said the Court, EPA can avoid taking further action in response to the section 202 petition \"only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion.\" It rejected EPA's stated policy reasons for refusing to regulate GHG emissions, such as its claim that voluntary executive branch programs already provide an effective response to climate change and that unilateral EPA regulation of vehicle GHG emissions could weaken U.S. efforts to persuade developing countries to reduce the GHG intensity of their economies. Such reasons \"have nothing to do with whether greenhouse gas emissions contribute to climate change.\" In short, said the Court, the only question is whether sufficient information exists to make an endangerment finding under section 202. Accordingly, the Supreme Court reversed the D.C. Circuit opinion and remanded the case to that court for further proceedings. On September 14, 2007, the D.C. Circuit vacated EPA's denial of the section 202 petition and remanded the matter to the agency. (Further developments are described in the following \"Aftermath\" section.) A four-justice dissent by Chief Justice Roberts in Massachusetts v. EPA disputed the majority's holding of standing. A dissent by Justice Scalia for the same four justices argued that agency policy preferences may appropriately be considered as part of EPA's decision whether to issue a \"judgment,\" conceding that the judgment, if made , must be limited to whether vehicle GHG emissions cause endangerment. Justice Scalia also disputed the majority's holding that \"air pollutant\" in section 202 includes GHGs. The Court's decision left EPA with three options: make a finding that motor vehicle GHG emissions may \"endanger public health or welfare\" and issue emissions standards; make a finding that such emissions do not satisfy that prerequisite; or decide that climate change science is so uncertain as to preclude making a finding either way (or cite some other \"reasonable explanation\" why it will not exercise its discretion either way). As to the state of climate change science, the Court's focus on the policy reasons EPA gave as part of exercising its \"judgment\" obscures the fact that the agency's rejection of the petition stemmed in part from expressions of scientific uncertainty in a 2001 National Research Council report on the science of climate change. Whether scientific reports since the petition rejection in 2003 have foreclosed the scientific-uncertainty rationale is beyond the scope of this report. The EPA Administrator did say after the decision that although it bars EPA use of policy considerations as a basis for denying the petition, it left open whether the agency can invoke them when actually writing the regulations, should the agency make an endangerment finding. CAA section 202 does not impose any stringency or other criteria on GHG emission standards promulgated under the section. Given the wide latitude EPA has in setting section 202 standards for GHGs, the possibility exists that EPA, following an endangerment finding, could set voluntary standards, or standards pegged to the CAFE standards for fuel economy, or standards that must be complied with only after the President certifies that developing nations have put adequate GHG emission limits into effect. In May, 2007, President Bush, in response to Massachusetts v. EPA , asked EPA to have CAA regulations limiting vehicle GHG emissions in place by the end of 2008 and to use the President's 2007 State of the Union proposal for raising the CAFE standards as a guide. As late as early December, 2007, EPA was consistently stating that it intended to issue proposed regulations by the end of 2007. However, the enactment of the Energy Independence and Security Act in December, 2007, with its increase in CAFE standards, led EPA to back off from any firm deadline for issuance of mobile-source GHG emission standards. In early 2008, EPA proposed instead to issue an advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) addressing the full range of Massachusetts v. EPA 's ramifications throughout the CAA, not just on section 202 standards. In response, the Massachusetts v. EPA petitioners in April, 2008 requested the D.C. Circuit to order EPA to comply with the Supreme Court's remand and the Circuit's mandate within 60 days (by choosing one of the three options noted earlier). The court denied the request in June, 2008. The following month, EPA issued a lengthy ANPR that, it said, \"reflects the complexity and magnitude of the question of whether and how greenhouse gases could be effectively controlled under the Clean Air Act\" —extending well beyond the narrow section 202 endangerment issue in the case. It warned that regulating GHGs under any provision of the CAA \"could result in an unprecedented expansion of EPA authority that would have a profound effect on virtually every sector of the economy....\" Apparently undaunted, the Obama Administration EPA issued a proposed endangerment finding on April 24, 2009, to be followed by a 60-day comment period after which the agency will decide whether to finalize the finding. If the finding is finalized, emission \"standards\" for GHGs must follow, though section 202 says nothing about what form these standards must take and how stringent they must be. As the ANPR asserts, the Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA has many implications beyond its four corners. On the substantive (non-standing) side, the Court's ruling upholding CAA coverage of GHG emissions from mobile sources improves the prospects of litigation seeking to have EPA restrict GHG emissions from stationary sources as well. The stationary-source provisions of the CAA use terms similar to that of section 202—in particular, \"air pollutant,\" \"in his judgment,\" and \"endanger.\" As the earlier subsection on suits seeking general CAA rulemaking indicated, such an effort to compel EPA regulation of stationary source GHGs is already underway as to NSPSs. Further, if EPA sets a national ambient air quality standard for CO 2 , GHGs would be covered under the CAA's new source review permitting program for major emitting facilities and modifications in Prevention of Significant Deterioration areas. Presumably, best available control technology for CO 2 emissions would then have to be installed on such facilities. On the mobile-source side, Massachusetts v. EPA is expressly relied upon in at least seven additional rulemaking petitions seeking EPA regulation of GHGs from mobile sources. As described in the ANPR, the petitions seek rulemaking under CAA sections 202(a)(3), 211, 213, and 231 to limit GHG emissions from (1) fuels and a wide array of mobile sources including ocean-going vessels, (2) all other types of nonroad engines and equipment, such as locomotives, construction equipment, farm tractors, forklifts, harbor crafts, and law and garden equipment, (3) aircraft, and (4) rebuilt heavy-duty highway engines. Beyond the federal clean air program, the Supreme Court's decision will likely be pivotal to the fortunes of plaintiffs in other climate change litigation owing to its discussion of standing. The question will be the extent to which the Court's finding of standing was contingent, as it obliquely suggested, on the existence of a state-sovereign plaintiff and the presence in the CAA of an explicit provision allowing the filing of administrative petitions. In the first major decision on this point, Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Department of the Interior , No. 07-1247 (D.C. Cir. April 17, 2009), a unanimous D.C. Circuit panel did indeed limit Massachusetts v. EPA to state plaintiffs (discussed in Section III and Section IV). Ironically, the \"environmental win\" in Massachusetts v. EPA has thwarted the environmental side in a climate-change-related nuisance case. One court used the decision as peripheral support for dismissing a nuisance action on \"political question\" grounds, reasoning that the Supreme Court has now found authority over GHG emissions to reside in the Federal Government. In the future, the decision may also undermine federal common law claims, on the argument that Congress intended to leave no room for courts to develop overlapping federal common law restricting GHG emissions. The Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) bars the taking of marine mammals, with exceptions. One exception is for \"incidental takings\" by specified activities. It provides that persons \"engage[d] in a specified activity (other than commercial fishing) within a specified geographical region\" may request the Secretary of the Interior or Commerce to authorize, for up to five years, the incidental, but not intentional, taking of small numbers of marine mammals. The Secretary must grant the authorization if he/she makes certain findings—including that the effect of the incidental take will be \"negligible\"—and promulgates rules setting out permissible methods of taking by the specified activity. In Center for Biological Diversity v. Kempthorne , No. 3:07-CV-0141 (D. Alaska April 22, 2008), transferred from No. 07-CV-00894 (N.D. Cal. filed February 13, 2007), environmental groups challenge one such \"incidental taking\" rule—authorizing the incidental take of polar bears and Pacific walrus for five years (2006-2011) resulting from oil and gas activities in the Beaufort Sea and adjacent coastal areas of the Alaska north slope. Plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the MMPA by permitting more than a \"negligible\" impact on the species, based on the combined impact of oil-and-gas activities and the weakened condition of polar bears due to climate change. The district court dismissed the suit, holding that the determination by the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) of negligible impact was reasonably based on the administrative record. An appeal has been filed. (This lawsuit also contains a National Environmental Policy Act claim, discussed in Section IV.) Under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), animals (and plants) may be listed as endangered or threatened. Particularly relevant to climate change litigation are ESA sections 9 (prohibitions) and 7 (consultation). Section 9 makes it unlawful to \"take\" a member of a listed endangered species, and has been extended by regulation to most threatened species. Exceptions from this \"take\" prohibition are possible, chiefly through incidental take permits. The other provision, section 7, demands that each federal agency \"insure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by such agency ... is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered species or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of [designated critical habitat] of such species....\" To achieve this goal, section 7 directs a federal agency to consult with the appropriate wildlife agency—the FWS or National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)—to determine the effect its action may have on listed species or their habitats. This is called \"section 7 consultation.\" Then, the FWS or NMFS prepares a \"biological opinion\" concluding either that the proposed action would not violate the mandate of no jeopardy or adverse modification, or that it would violate the mandate, in which case FWS or NMFS must suggest \"reasonable and prudent alternatives\" that would not violate the mandate. In Natural Resources Defense Council v. Kempthorne , 506 F. Supp. 2d 322 (E.D. Cal. 2007), environmental and sport fishing groups attacked the FWS biological opinion prepared for the 2004 Long-Term Central Valley Project and State Water Project Operations Criteria and Plan and certain related future actions. The biological opinion concluded that project operations would not jeopardize the continued existence of the Delta smelt, a threatened species, or adversely modify its designated critical habitat—that is, would not violate ESA section 7. The court, however, held that the biological opinion was arbitrary and capricious in ignoring data about climate change that may adversely affect the Delta smelt and its habitat. The court observed, for example, that the opinion was based on the assumption that the hydrology of the waters affected by the 2004 plan would follow historical patterns for the next 20 years, an assumption that studies on the potential effects of climate change on water supply reliability did not support. A companion case before the same judge, Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations/Institute for Fisheries Resources v. Gutierrez , No. 1:06-CV-00245, 2008 WL 2223070 (E.D.Cal. May 20, 2008), successfully challenged the NMFS biological opinion prepared in connection with the same project for various salmon and trout species—based on its \"total failure to address, adequately explain, and analyze the effects of global climate change on the species.\" Id. at *60. More ESA cases are likely on the way in connection with a campaign spearheaded by the Center for Biological Diversity (CBD). CBD has filed multiple petitions to have animals listed as endangered or threatened due in various degrees to climate change impacts on their habitat. Given that some of these petitions have been successful (and more may be in the future), the Center is likely to test in court whether substantial GHG sources run afoul of protections afforded those species by the ESA. Three climate-change-related proposals to list a species have reached the actual listing stage thus far. The first, in which climate change was only a contributing factor, was NMFS' listing of the staghorn coral and elkhorn coral as threatened in 2006. The second, garnering considerably more attention, was the May 15, 2008 listing of the polar bear as threatened, under pressure of a court-imposed deadline requiring a decision for or against listing by that date. The polar bear listing was based largely on the many studies as to the disproportionately large impact of climate change on the Arctic and the resulting loss of sea ice required by polar bears as habitat. The third, again with climate change but a contributing factor, is NMFS' listing of the black abalone as endangered in 2009. In addition to the coral, polar bear, and abalone, CBD has petitioned the FWS to list as either endangered or threatened Kittlitz's murrelet, a seabird (2001), 12 species of penguins (2006), the American pika, an alpine mammal (2007), the ashy storm-petrel, another seabird (2007), the ribbon seal (2007), the Pacific walrus (2008), and the ringed, bearded, and spotted seals (2008). In each instance, the Center asserts global warming to be a cause, principal or otherwise, of the species' plight. (Not included in this report are the CBD suits challenging agency failures to make the statutorily mandated interim findings in the petition process for listing, known as 90-day or 12-month findings.) With the listing of the corals and polar bear—particularly the latter where the climate change nexus is so clear—the question moves to the fore whether operating a fossil-fuel-fired power plant or other major GHG source violates section 9—causes a prohibited \"take\"—through the effects of its GHG emissions, via climate change, on polar bear habitat. Notable here is that \"take\" is statutorily defined to include \"harm\" to a member of a listed species, and \"harm,\" in turn, is defined by regulation to include certain \"significant habitat modification[s] or degradation[s].\" The crux, presumably, is whether the causal link between the power plant's GHG emissions and the effect on the species habitat is sufficiently direct and substantial to constitute a \"take,\" a question beyond the scope of this report. If a take is found, the power plant would require an incidental take permit to operate, such permit likely containing restrictions on the amount of GHGs that could be emitted. Likewise, the argument runs, a federal agency issuing a permit for power plant construction might have to initiate section 7 consultation. In 2008, under the George W. Bush Administration, the FWS repeatedly asserted that its listing of the polar bear would not implicate the ESA – neither section 9 nor section 7 – based on the GHG emissions from an activity. The FWS sought to ensure the irrelevance of GHG emissions to the ESA in several ways. One way was by issuing a \"special rule\" for the polar bear under ESA section 4(d) stating that section 9 \"take\" prohibitions do not apply to \"any taking of polar bears that is incidental to, but not the purpose of, carrying out an otherwise lawful activity\" occurring anywhere in the United States except Alaska. A half-dozen or more lawsuits challenging the polar bear listing and the accompanying \"special rule\"—most including grounds related to climate change—were consolidated on December 3, 2008 in the D.C. federal district court by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation. Another way used by FWS (and NMFS) in 2008 to keep the ESA and GHG emissions separate was by amending the section 7 consultation regulations to say, for example, that no consultation is required when a federal agency action is not anticipated to result in \"take\" and the action's effects are \"manifested through global processes\" and either (a) cannot be reliably predicted at the scale of the species' range, or (b) will have insignificant impact on the species or its habitat. With the arrival of the Obama Administration, Congress in 2009 allowed the relevant Secretary (of the Interior, with regard to FWS; of Commerce, with regard to NMFS) 60 days in which to withdraw the polar bear special rule and/or the 2008 amendments to the consultation regulations \"without regard to any provision of statute or regulation that establishes a requirement for such withdrawal.\" This streamlined withdrawal authority was exercised on May 4, 2009, solely with regard to the amendments of the consultation regulations, reinstating the prior version. Owing to the withdrawal, the lawsuits challenging the amended rule (filed by environmental groups and nine states) were dismissed on May 14, 2009. In Center for Biological Diversity v. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , 538 F.3d 1172 (9 th Cir. 2008), 11 states (CA, CT, ME, MA, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, VT, MN), environmental groups and others attacked a 2006 rule promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA). The rule established corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for light-duty trucks—defined by NHTSA to include many SUVs, vans, and pickup trucks—in model years 2008 through 2011. EPCA says that the light-truck CAFE standard shall be the \"maximum feasible\" standard that manufacturers can achieve in a given model year. The court found that even assuming NHTSA may use a cost-benefit analysis to determine the \"maximum feasible\" standard, it was arbitrary and capricious not to include in the analysis the benefit of carbon emissions reduction—calling this \"the most significant benefit of more stringent CAFE standards.\" NHTSA had argued, for example, that the wide range of values put forward in studies as to how the benefits of reduced GHG emissions should be monetized justified placing no value on that benefit in its cost-benefit analysis. The court countered that while there is indeed a range of values in the studies, they are all greater than zero. Accordingly, the court remanded the CAFE standard to NHTSA for the agency to include a monetized value for carbon emission reduction in its analysis of the proper CAFE standard. (There was also a climate-change-related NEPA claim in this lawsuit, discussed in Section IV.) Quite recently, CBD filed a petition for review of NHTSA's rule setting the standard for model year 2011 passenger cars and light trucks. It is unclear from the tersely worded petition whether climate change concerns underlie this suit, though given the court decision immediately above, it seems likely. In Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior , No. 07-1247 (D.C. Cir. April 17, 2009), the court rejected the climate change arguments made against the Secretary of the Interior's approval of the Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program 2007-2012 under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA). Petitioners alleged that the Secretary violated OCSLA by failing to analyze the climate change impacts from the GHG emissions resulting from the consumption of oil and gas produced under the program. Adopting the argument of the United States, the court held that the Supreme Court's standing discussion in Massachusetts v. EPA is limited to state plaintiffs, and thus did not aid petitioners. Being unable, in the court's view, to satisfy the standing elements of injury in fact and causation under a traditional analysis, petitioners were held to lack regular standing—though they were found to have procedural rights standing. On that latter basis, the court proceeded to petitioners' OCSLA claims, finding that they failed because \"OCSLA does not require Interior to consider the global environmental impact of oil and gas consumption before approving a Leasing program.\" Interior may properly limit the scope of its environmental inquiry to the effect of the Program's production activities. Despite the failure of these climate change claims, the Leasing Program was vacated and remanded on other grounds. (There was also a climate-change-related NEPA claim, discussed in Section IV.) Much of the climate change litigation is based on statutory requirements that the government generate, compile, or disclose information. The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) cases involving climate change represent the oldest and most numerous category of climate change litigation. To be sure, NEPA is more than just an information statute, declaring as it does a sweeping policy that the federal government must consider the environmental impacts of its actions. However, NEPA ensures that such environmental consideration will occur chiefly through the production of information, in the form of environmental assessments and environmental impact statements, and does not require that an agency choose from among its options the one with the least environmental impact. The dominant issue has been whether plaintiffs have standing to sue—as mentioned, an issue on which plaintiffs may be helped (but so far have not) by the 2007 Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA . Thus, all the standing issues discussed here should be viewed through the prism of that decision. The standing determination has been particularly difficult in the context of NEPA, which confers only a procedural right (having a federal agency prepare an adequate environmental impact statement (EIS)), not a substantive right (having the agency select a particular course of action after preparing the EIS). Massachusetts v. EPA addressed only substantive-rights standing, not procedural-rights standing, though the analyses often overlap. Where courts have found standing and reached the merits, they have usually accepted that climate change impacts in the proper circumstances are a required consideration in an EIS. Standing barriers have proved particularly daunting in the D.C. Circuit, and Massachusetts v. EPA has thus far been construed narrowly. In the first significant climate change case under any law, City of Los Angeles v. National Highway Traffic Safety Admin ., 912 F.3d 478 (D.C. Cir. 1990), the city attacked a NHTSA decision not to prepare an EIS when it set the corporate average fuel economy standard at 26.5 mpg for model year 1989 passenger cars—below the statutory default setting of 27.5 mpg. A majority of the D.C. Circuit concluded that petitioners had standing based on their argument that had NHTSA done an EIS considering the climate change impacts of its one mpg rollback, the agency might have rejected it. This provided the requisite causal nexus, said the majority, between NHTSA's decision not to do an EIS and climate change. In dissent, however, one judge argued that Article III demanded a more precise causal showing, with clear proof of a nexus between the agency action and harm to the petitioners. On the merits, one judge in the majority concluded that NHTSA had \"inadequately explained why the admitted increase in carbon dioxide is insignificant within the context of the environmental harm posed by global warming.\" She would have remanded NHTSA's NEPA decision but left the rollback in place in the meantime. Because the other majority judge ruled for the agency, however, the petition was denied. The plaintiff-friendly City of Los Angeles standard for finding global-warming-based standing was to prove short-lived. Six years later, a divided D.C. Circuit declared en banc that to obtain standing, a procedural-rights plaintiff must show not only that the government omitted a required procedure, but that it is substantially probable that the procedural omission will cause a particularized injury to the plaintiff —adopting the dissenter's position in that case. To the extent City of Los Angeles dispensed with the second, causation-of-a-particularized-plaintiff-injury requirement, it was expressly overruled. Still later court decisions, however, have cast doubt on this strict standard. In Foundation on Economic Trends v. Watkins , 794 F. Supp. 395 (D.D.C. 1992), the standing bar was raised during, rather than after, the litigation. Plaintiffs claimed that NEPA required the Secretaries of Energy, Agriculture, and the Interior to evaluate the effect on climate change of 42 actions and programs under their authority. Plaintiffs' standing argument was based on \"informational standing,\" under which failure to do an EIS discussing possible climate change impacts satisfies the injury requirement of standing merely by harming plaintiffs' programs for disseminating information about climate change to the public. In so arguing, plaintiffs relied on a line of D.C. Circuit decisions going back two decades. Unfortunately for them, however, informational standing was limited by the D.C. Circuit during the pendency of their suit. An amended complaint by the individual plaintiff, arguing that his expected use of his oceanfront cottage may be curtailed if oceans rise from climate change, was also rejected. Among other things, said the court, the plaintiff had not met the causation requirement of standing in that he had not related the environmental harm he predicted to any of the 42 challenged agency actions. \"[T]here is no 'global warming' exception to the standing requirements of Article III or the [Administrative Procedure Act],\" it asserted. In a decision also described in Section III, Center for Biological Diversity v. U.S. Dep't of the Interior , No. 07-1247 (D.C. Cir. April 17, 2009), petitioners charged that the department violated NEPA in approving its five-year Outer Continental Shelf oil and gas leasing program. As relevant here, petitioners pointed to the department's failure to account for the impacts of climate change on the Program areas, and the impact on climate change of the additional oil and gas consumption caused by the Program. The court held that petitioners had procedural rights standing, but found their NEPA claims unripe, explaining that at the point petitioners filed their petitions, Interior had only approved the Leasing Program; no lease sales had occurred. The Leasing Program had therefore not yet reached the critical stage where an irreversible commitment of resources occurs. Despite the failure of these climate-change-related claims, the court vacated and remanded the Leasing Program on other grounds. In Montana Environmental Information Center v. Johanns , No. 07-CV-1311 (D.D.C. filed July 23, 2007), dismissed March 20, 2008, challenge was made to the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utility Service's use of low-interest loans to help finance the construction of at least eight new coal-fired powerplants. The charge was that the EIS for one plant is deficient because it fails to consider the cumulative impacts of GHG emissions from the eight new plants. Finally, in Sierra Club v. U.S. D e partment of Agriculture , No. 07-cv-1860 (D.D.C. filed October 16, 2007), that group challenges the failure of the Department of Agriculture's Rural Utility Service to conduct any environmental analysis under NEPA before participating in and approving a number of business agreements that were needed for a project. The project involves the construction of up to three new 700-megawatt coal-fired electric generating units at Sunflower Electric Power Corporation's existing coal-fired power plant in Kansas. (See discussion of further litigation involving this proposal under \" VII. State Statutes .\") The standing barriers in the D.C. Circuit seem to be attenuated in the Ninth Circuit where, as far as research reveals, plaintiffs raising climate change claims in NEPA suits have yet to encounter standing problems. In 2002, environmental groups sued the Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC) and Export-Import Bank of the United States alleging continued failure to comply with NEPA. These federal agencies provide insurance, loans, and loan guarantees for overseas projects, or to U.S. companies that invest in overseas projects. Plaintiffs alleged that these overseas projects include oil and gas extraction and refining, and power plants, which together result in the annual emission of billions of tons of GHGs, causing climate change in the United States. In 2005, the district court held that plaintiffs had standing, given what it saw to be the relaxed standards in the Ninth Circuit for showing standing in cases alleging procedural violations—here, failure to prepare an EIS. Friends of the Earth v. Mosbacher , 2005 Westlaw 2035596 (N.D. Cal. 2005). It is \"reasonably probable,\" said the court, that emissions from projects supported by the defendants will threaten plaintiffs' concrete interests. In 2007, the court reached the merits, holding on summary judgment motions that defendants need not prepare a programmatic EIS for the energy projects they finance, and that neither side had shown, as a matter of law, that energy projects specifically listed in the complaint are or are not \"major Federal actions\" requiring an EIS. 488 F. Supp. 2d 889 (N.D. Cal. 2007). The case was settled February 6, 2009, the Export-Import Bank and OPIC agreeing to implement various measures for considering the GHG emissions of supported projects. In Border Power Plant Working Group v. Dep't of Energy , 260 F. Supp. 2d 997 (S.D. Cal. 2003), plaintiff challenged the environmental assessment accompanying applications for permits and federal rights of way to build electricity transmission lines connecting new power plants in Mexico with the power grid in Southern California. In part because four of its members were seen to have procedural standing, the plaintiff organization was held to have organizational standing. The court's standing discussion made no mention of climate change, however, perhaps because climate change was only a small part of plaintiff's case. On the merits, the court agreed with plaintiff that the environmental assessment was legally inadequate because, among other things, it failed to discuss CO 2 emissions from the powerplants and \"[t]he record shows that carbon dioxide ... is a greenhouse gas.\" The decision in Center for Biological Diversity v. NHTSA , 538 F.3d 1172 (9 th Cir. 2008), offers a deja vu to City of Los Angeles , discussed earlier in this section. Both cases involve a NHTSA rule setting a corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standard—this time, for light-duty trucks (model years 2008-2011) —and in both cases, the agency did no EIS. Petitioners include 11 states (CA, CT, ME, MA, NJ, NM, NY, OR, RI, VT, MN) and four environmental groups. In sharp contrast with earlier NEPA/climate-change decisions, the United States in this case did not contest standing and the court decision does not mention it. On the merits, the court held that NHTSA's environmental assessment for its CAFE rule, finding no significant impact, was inadequate owing to, among other things, its analysis of the rule's cumulative impacts from GHG emissions. Said the court: \"The impact of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change is precisely the kind of cumulative impacts analysis that NEPA requires agencies to conduct.\" Nor did the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the statute authorizing CAFE standards, limit NHTSA's duty to assess environmental impacts such as climate change. More specifically, while NHTSA's assessment indicated the expected amount of CO 2 emitted by light-duty trucks under the new CAFE standard, it failed to \"evaluate the 'incremental impact' that these emissions will have on climate change ... in light of other past, present, and reasonably foreseeable actions such as other light truck and passenger automobile CAFE standards.\" Finally, the court invoked the well-settled principle that an EIS must be prepared if substantial questions are raised as to whether a proposed project may have significant environmental impact, and held that petitioners' evidence raised the necessary level of doubt. Thus, the court ordered preparation of a full EIS. (There was also a climate change-related Energy Policy and Conservation Act claim, discussed in Section III.) In Center for Biological Diversity v. Kempthorne , No. 3:07-CV-0141 (D. Alaska), transferred from No. 07-CV-00894 (N.D. Cal. filed February 13, 2007), environmental groups challenge a Fish and Wildlife Service \"incidental taking\" rule. As described in Section II, the rule authorizes the incidental take of polar bears and Pacific walrus by oil and gas activities in the Beaufort Sea and adjacent coastal areas of the Alaska north slope, from 2006 to 2011. Plaintiffs challenge the environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, charging that the Service put out the rule \"without seriously analyzing the effects of climate change on them or their habitat.\" The accusation is not that the oil and gas activities themselves contribute to climate change, but that direct harms to polar bears and walruses from those activities will be exacerbated by climate change impacts on the Arctic that are already stressing those species. In April, 2008, the district court ruled that the FWS had been reasonable in finding that the impacts of oil and gas activities in and along the Beaufort Sea, over the next five years, will fall short of NEPA's \"significant\" threshold for requiring environmental assessments. An appeal has been filed. In Mid States Coalition for Progress v. Surface Transportation Bd ., 345 F.3d 520 (8 th Cir. 2003), petitioners disputed the adequacy of an EIS prepared by the Surface Transportation Board to accompany its approval of a railroad's proposal to construct new rail and upgrade existing rail. The proposed rail line was to provide a less expensive route by which low-sulfur coal in Wyoming's Powder River Basin could reach powerplants, and thus might be expected to increase coal consumption and its attendant effects. In this regard, the court noted that CEQ's NEPA regulations require that EISs cover both direct and indirect effects of proposed actions. It concluded by finding it \"irresponsible\" for the Board to approve such a large project without first examining the possible effects of an increase in coal consumption—apparently, the opinion suggests (but does not explicitly say), including climate change. In Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund v. Conner , No. 07-CV-01023 (D.S.D. filed October 24, 2007), plaintiffs challenge Department of Agriculture regulations easing restrictions on the import of live cattle and edible bovine products from \"minimal risk\" Mad Cow Disease regions (Canada). Plaintiffs assert that the environmental assessment was inadequate because it did not analyze the increased GHG emissions from the transportation of the cattle into the United States. A few GHG-related suits also have been filed under state \"little NEPAs\"—state laws requiring state (and sometimes local) agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their proposed actions, just as the federal NEPA does for federal agencies. For example, in General Motors Corp. v. California Air Resources Bd ., No. 05-02787 (Cal. Sup. Ct. filed September 2, 2005), two car manufacturers claimed that the Board's adoption of California's GHG emission standards involved delayed and inadequate compliance with the state's NEPA-type law. This suit offers as a prime reason for environmental analysis the argument that GHG emissions regulation has, in addition to a possible benefit, some environmental downsides. In particular, it contends that restriction of GHG emissions may cause an increase in new-vehicle sticker prices and a consequent decrease in the rate at which old, higher-emissions vehicles are retired from use. Invoking California's NEPA-like statute (the California Environmental Quality Act), conservation groups and California attorney general Jerry Brown sued in 2007 to require San Bernardino County, the largest county in the US by area, to address climate change in its General Plan update. Later that year, California settled its lawsuit, the county agreeing to prepare a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan and adopt other measures. Later, the conservation groups took a voluntary dismissal of their suit after extracting promises from the county to do a mapping of wildlife habitat and research on wildfire dangers. In broaching the vast realm of local land use plans, these cases portend a major new front in climate change litigation, particularly in states that require environmental impact analysis. The Global Change Research Act of 1990 (GCRA) commands the President to create an interagency United States Global Change Research Program to improve understanding of \"global change.\" Global change is defined broadly by the GCRA to include all changes in the global environment \"that may alter the capacity of the Earth to sustain life.\" Thus, the statute includes, but goes beyond, climate change. The Program is to be implemented by a National Global Change Research Plan, with regular scientific assessments that evaluate the findings of the Program. The GCRA demands that revised Research Plans be submitted to the Congress at least every three years, with the last one having been submitted July, 2003. The statute further demands that scientific assessments be submitted to the President and Congress not less often than every four years, with the only assessment to date submitted October, 2000. On these undisputed facts, the district court in Center for Biological Diversity v. Brennan , 571 F. Supp. 2d 1105 (N.D. Cal. 2007), had little difficulty finding that the Bush Administration had unlawfully withheld action it was required to take. It ordered defendants to publish a summary of the revised proposed Research Plan no later than March, 2008, with submission to Congress no later than 90 days thereafter. The court further ordered the scientific assessment to be produced by May, 2008. It should be noted that the great bulk of this opinion is devoted not to the foregoing violation and remedy, but to threshold matters: standing (finding procedural rights injury and informational injury, associational standing, and Administrative Procedure Act standing) and a motion to intervene by two Members of Congress (denied). The Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) mandates that documents in the possession of federal executive branch agencies are to be disclosed to the public upon request, unless covered by a FOIA exemption. In May, 2006, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) invoked FOIA to request from the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) all of its records relating to the causes of climate change, from January 20, 2001, to October 26, 2006. Though CEQ produced many documents, CREW sued under FOIA seeking a court order that CEQ release all records responsive to its request. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington v. Council on Environmental Quality , No. 1:07CV00365 (D.D.C. filed February 20, 2007). The case has been stayed while CEQ efforts to comply continue. This lawsuit parallels allegations at the time that political appointees in the Bush Administration CEQ edited many of the agency's reports to minimize the danger and human causes of climate change. In July, 2006, the House Committee on Government Reform requested that CEQ provide documents and communications relating to the agency's edits of climate change materials, its efforts to influence the statements of government scientists, its communications with federal agencies and nongovernmental parties regarding climate change, and so on. A report making findings was issued in December, 2007, with minority views. The widely diverse injuries predicted from climate change mean that a comparably diverse spectrum of plaintiffs and defendants could become involved in common law tort litigation based on such injuries. Possible plaintiffs include property owners (farmers dealing with reduced rainfall, owners of oceanfront homes dealing with rising sea level or increased storm activity), nonowner users of natural resources (ski resort operators, commercial fishermen), and state attorneys general bringing private or public nuisance claims (the former for injury to state-owned land, the latter on behalf of the state's citizenry to protect public health and well-being). Possible defendants include the companies that produce the fossil fuels whose combustion produces GHG emissions, entities that emit GHGs (chiefly fossil-fuel-fired powerplants, but many other sources also), and companies that manufacture or market products whose use creates GHG emissions (chiefly the automakers). Several of these potential plaintiff and defendant categories are represented in the five climate-change-related tort cases known to be filed thus far (four discussed in the following text, one in footnote 130 ). Thus far, all of those tort actions that have produced court decisions have failed, either due to lack of standing or the political question doctrine, or both. Three are on appeal, however. Nuisance has been the principal tort theory used in cases seeking relief (injunctive or monetary) from harms caused by climate change. In 2004, eight states (CA, CT, IA, NJ, NY, RI, VT, WI) and New York City sued five electric utility companies. Connecticut v. American Electric Power Co. , Civ. No. 04 CV 05669 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 21, 2004). These defendants were chosen as allegedly the five largest CO 2 emitters in the United States, through their fossil-fuel-fired electric powerplants. Invoking the federal and state common law of public nuisance, plaintiffs seek an injunction requiring defendants to abate their contribution to the nuisance of climate change by capping CO 2 emissions and then reducing them. Plaintiffs sue both on their own behalf to protect state-owned property (e.g., the hardwood forests of the Adirondack Park in New York), and as parens patriae on behalf of their citizens and residents to protect public health and well-being. On the same day, three land trusts filed a similar suit against the same defendants, in the same court, adding a private nuisance claim. Open Space Institute v. American Electric Power Co. , No. 04 CV 05670 (S.D.N.Y. filed July 21, 2004). They seek to protect land owned and preserved by them in the state of New York, which they claim to be threatened by climate change. This suit was consolidated with the state suit. In a series of motions, defendants sought to have these actions dismissed on a wide spectrum of threshold grounds. Though the case has now been decided by the trial court on a single threshold issue, it is worth reviewing some of the grounds advanced in these motions because they may reappear later, in this or other private GHG litigation. To reiterate, many of these grounds typify the difficulties encountered when one seeks to address through private litigation a ubiquitous, long-term environmental problem to which countless parties contribute. In a dismissal motion, some defendants argued there is no federal common law cause of action for climate change. Creating such federal common law, they argued, runs afoul of Supreme Court directives that federal courts do so only in limited areas—especially where, as with climate change, the problem at issue has sweeping implications. Even assuming a viable federal common-law nuisance theory, they continued, Congress's enactment of a comprehensive scheme of air pollution regulation in the CAA displaces federal court authority in this area. Defendants also challenge plaintiffs' standing to sue. Plaintiffs, they argued, have not demonstrated the \"injury in fact\" requisite of standing because they allege only injuries from climate change in the indefinite future. Nor, said these defendants, have plaintiffs shown \"causation\" because they do not allege that defendants' conduct will directly cause the consequences of climate change—especially since defendants' collective emissions are admitted to be less than 2-1/2% of the global total from human activities. As mentioned, the viability of these federal common law of nuisance and no-standing arguments by defendants may be significantly affected—the displacement argument helped, the others hurt—by Massachusetts v. EPA . Another motion to dismiss asserted that to the limited extent a federal common law claim to abate an interstate nuisance has been recognized, it has been limited to actions brought by state entities. Nor, said defendants, can plaintiffs assert public nuisance, because they have not alleged special injury to their properties, or private nuisance, because they have not alleged substantial harm. As indicated, the dismissal motions in Connecticut and Open Space Institute have now been ruled on by the district court, which dismissed the cases on political question grounds. This judicial doctrine requires a court to look into \"the appropriateness under our system of government of attributing finality to the action of the political departments [i.e., the legislative and executive branches] and also the lack of satisfactory criteria for a judicial determination....\" One situation judicially recognized as pointing to a political question, hence dismissal of the action, is \"the impossibility of deciding [the case] without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\" This situation, said the court, perfectly fit the GHG cases, touching as they do on so many areas of national and international policy. As a political question, the court believed the climate change issue in these suits to be for the legislature, not the courts, to resolve. Very possibly, the amorphousness of nuisance law, giving the court little guidance in resolving these cases, may have hurt the plaintiffs' cause. These cases are now on appeal to the Second Circuit. A second nuisance action was filed in 2006 by California against several automobile manufacturers based on the alleged contributions of their vehicles to climate change impacts in the state. The suit asserts that these impacts constitute a public nuisance under federal or state common law, and seeks monetary damages (plaintiffs in Connecticut seek injunctive relief). The district court dismissed the suit on the same political-question rationale as in Connecticut —namely, \"the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion.\" California v. General Motors Corp ., 2007 Westlaw 2726871 (N.D. Cal. September 17, 2007). The need for an \"initial policy determination\" by the political branches was supported, in the court's view, by the complexity of the climate change issue, the need for political guidance in divining what is an \"unreasonable\" interference with the public's rights (the definition of a public nuisance), and the global warming debate in the political branches. Ironically, the environmental \"win\" in Massachusetts v. EPA was cited by the court against the state, both because that decision found authority over GHG emissions to lie with the federal government and because it recognized a state's standing to press its grievances at the federal level. An appeal to the Ninth Circuit is pending. Most recently, a native village on the northwest Alaska coast sued certain oil and energy companies, claiming that the large quantities of GHGs they emit collectively contribute to climate change. Climate change, the village contends, is destroying the village by melting Arctic sea ice that formerly protected it from winter storms, leading to massive coastal erosion. Native Village of Kivalina v. Exxonmobil Corp ., No. 08-cv-01138 (N.D. Cal. filed February 26, 2008). Indeed, the complaint asserts, \"[t]he U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and U.S. Government Accountability Office have both concluded that the village must be relocated due to global warming....\" The village invokes the federal common law of public nuisance, and state statutory or common law of private and public nuisance, and makes a civil conspiracy claim. The conspiracy claim asserts that some of the defendants have engaged in agreements to participate in the intentional creation or maintenance of a public nuisance—that is, global warming—by misleading the public as to the science of global warming. The suit seeks monetary damages. Owners of Mississippi property damaged by Hurricane Katrina sued certain oil, coal, and chemical companies, alleging a multistep chain of causation: the companies emitted GHGs, which contributed to global warming, which made the waters of the Gulf of Mexico warmer, which caused Hurricane Katrina to become more intense as it passed over the Gulf than it would otherwise have been, which increased the harm to plaintiffs' property caused by the hurricane. Plaintiffs asserted various state-law tort claims, including negligence, nuisance (public and private), and trespass, and seek compensatory damages; they request punitive damages for gross negligence. Further, they claimed fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud, alleging that the oil and coal companies disseminated misinformation about global warming. Finally, plaintiffs made claims against their home insurance companies (e.g., breach of fiduciary duty claim for misrepresenting policy coverage, and violation of a state consumer-protection act) and their mortgage companies (arguing that they may not claim sums owed by plaintiffs for the value of the mortgaged property that was uninsured). The district court, sitting in diversity, dismissed the action for lack of plaintiff standing. Comer v. Murphy Oil USA, Inc. , Civ. Action No. 1:05-CV-436-LG-RHW (S.D. Miss. August 30, 2007). With regard to certain defendants, the court also found plaintiffs' claims nonjusticiable under the political question doctrine—as in the decisions above where nuisance was the sole legal theory advanced. An appeal to the Fifth Circuit is pending. The question of whether federal law preempts state regulation of GHG emissions arises chiefly in connection with mobile sources. With limited exceptions, the CAA disclaims any intention to preempt state air pollution controls on stationary sources. And the Energy Policy and Conservation Act does not set fuel economy standards for other than mobile sources, so it too would be unlikely to preempt state regulation of stationary sources. However, some have asserted that state regulation of stationary-source GHGs is preempted as contrary to the federal government's authority over foreign policy—an argument being pressed, so far unsuccessfully, in litigation attacking state regulation of mobile-source GHG emissions (see below). The most prominent state enactment limiting GHG emissions from stationary sources is that of California, which as yet has not been challenged. The picture is quite different for mobile sources, where preemption is the general rule. The CAA preempts states from adopting any \"standard relating to the control of emissions from new motor vehicles ...,\" and the act defines \"emission standard\" as certain limits on \"emissions of air pollutants .\" The Supreme Court has now held that at least for purposes of mobile sources, \"air pollutants\" includes GHGs. Thus, CAA preemption of state regulation of car and truck GHG emissions is clear, whether or not EPA proceeds to regulate a particular mobile-source GHG. It would seem, then, that states are preempted from setting emission standards for CO 2 , methane, and hydrofluorocarbons—three substances said to enhance climate change—even though EPA has not set mobile-source emission standards for them. An exception to the general CAA rule preempting state mobile-source emission regulation is that EPA may waive CAA preemption for one particular state, California, if that state requests a waiver. Further, when EPA does grant California a waiver, the act automatically extends it to almost all states with mobile-source emission limits identical to California's. Under this \"California waiver\" authority, California requested a preemption waiver for its GHG emissions regulations on December 21, 2005. These regulations had been promulgated under a 2002 California enactment that was the first in the nation to call for limits on GHG emissions from mobile sources. Assembly Bill 1493 instructs the California Air Resources Board (CARB) to adopt regulations that achieve the maximum feasible reduction of GHGs emitted by passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks. The CARB adopted the required regulations in 2004. The regulations target CO 2 , methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbon emissions, setting \"fleet average greenhouse gas exhaust mass emission requirements for passenger car, light-duty truck, and medium-duty passenger vehicle weight classes.\" The first model year to which the fleet averages apply is 2009. The averages are reduced for each subsequent model year through 2016. On December 19, 2007, almost two years after California requested the waiver, the EPA Administrator wrote the California governor that he intended to deny the state's request. On January 3, 2008, two petitions for review of this letter, arguing that it constituted final agency action on the waiver request, were filed in the Ninth Circuit. However, with the issuance of EPA's March 6 decision document, these suits based on the EPA letter were dismissed and replaced by a suit in the D.C. Circuit challenging that document. Petitioners in State of California v. U.S. EPA , No. 08-1178 (D.C. Cir. filed May 5, 2008) are California, 18 other states, and numerous environmental groups. Most of the California congressional delegation, including Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senators Boxer and Feinstein, are participating as amici in support of the petitioners. With the arrival of President Obama, the California Air Resources Board and President Obama (by executive order) requested EPA to reopen the waiver-denial matter—which EPA did on February 12, 2009. On February 25, 2009, motion was granted to hold State of California in abeyance pending the Obama Administration EPA's reconsideration of California's petition. That the CAA preempts state GHG regulation of mobile sources cannot be seriously questioned, absent a California waiver. The following preemption litigation is significant for the non-CAA preemption claims being pressed. If successful, these claims would prevent California and other states from implementing the California mobile-source standards even if EPA's denial of the waiver is administratively or judicially reversed. The chief non-CAA preemption theory in this litigation is based on the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, also noted in Section III). EPCA is the authority under which the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) establishes corporate average fuel economy standards (\"CAFE standards\"). As recently amended, EPCA requires NHTSA to prescribe separate fuel economy standards for passenger and non-passenger automobiles beginning with model year 2011, to achieve a combined fuel economy average for model year 2020 of at least 35 miles per gallon. More pertinent here, EPCA preempts states from adopting laws \"related to\" the federal fuel economy standards. The auto industry argues that the only known way to reduce GHG emissions is to improve gas mileage, so that a state regulation of auto GHG emissions is a law \"related to\" the federal emission standard, hence invalid. Non-CAA preemption suits, brought by auto interests, are pending in four of the federal judicial circuits containing a state that has adopted GHG controls on vehicles. Two decisions on the merits have been handed down, from Vermont (First Circuit) and California (Ninth Circuit). Both reject the preemption theories presented. In the first to be decided, Green Mountain Chrysler Plymouth Dodge v. Crombie , 508 F. Supp. 2d 295 (D. Vt. 2007), the court ruled that the relationship between Vermont's California-identical GHG standards and EPCA was better analyzed as an interplay between two federal statutes (EPCA and the CAA) rather than as a federal preemption question. So viewing the matter, the court pointed out that NHTSA has consistently treated EPA-approved California mobile source emissions standards as constituting \"other motor vehicle standards of the Government,\" which EPCA says NHTSA must consider when setting CAFE standards. This suggests that EPCA was meant to coexist with the CAA, rather than supersede it. Moreover, noted the court, in a related context the Supreme Court's Massachusetts v. EPA decision saw the EPCA CAFE provisions as harmonious with the CAA. Thus, the court found the relationship between the CAA waiver authority and the EPCA CAFE provisions to be one of overlap, but not conflict. Despite its conclusion that preemption doctrine did not apply, the court did a preemption analysis anyway, finding that Vermont's GHG standards were preempted neither by EPCA nor as an intrusion upon the foreign policy authority of the United States. An appeal is pending. In the second decision, Central Valley Chrysler-Jeep, Inc. v. Goldstene , 529 F. Supp. 2d 1151 (E.D. Cal. 2007), a district court similarly rejected claims that California's regulation of GHG emissions from cars and trucks was precluded by EPCA, preempted by EPCA, or preempted as an intrusion of state law on federal authority to conduct foreign affairs. An appeal in this case is pending as well. The legal theories pressed in the Crombie and Goldstene litigation are similar to those in two Rhode Island suits, consolidated as Lincoln Dodge, Inc. v. Sullivan , No. 1:06-CV-00070 (D.R.I. filed February 13, 2006), challenging that state's adoption of the California standards. Recently, the district court held that the claims of the auto manufacturers and trade associations in this case were barred by collateral estoppel, a legal doctrine that prohibits parties from relitigating issues they have already adjudicated, as these plaintiffs had done in Crombie and Goldstene . The Rhode Island auto dealers, by contrast, had themselves never raised the issues in the case and thus were held to be viable plaintiffs, allowing the case to proceed. In yet another preemption case, New Mexico's adoption of the California GHG standards has been challenged as preempted under EPCA in Zangara Dodge, Inc. v. Curry , No. 1:07-CV-01305 (D.N.M. filed December 27, 2007). The first climate-change decision involving state statutes (other than nuisance statutes) appears to be Matter of Quantification of Environmental Costs , 578 N.W.2d 794 (Minn. App. 1998). This case involved a state law requiring the state's public utilities commission to determine environmental cost values for each method of energy generation, and to use those values in proceedings before the commission. The commission set values for six pollutants, including CO 2 . Petitioners' challenge to the CO 2 value was rejected on the grounds that (a) notwithstanding the speculative nature of some of the data, the ALJ conducted a careful review based on sufficient evidence in the record, (b) the determination that CO 2 negatively affects the environment was proper, and (c) the determination as to CO 2 value otherwise comported with the governing statute. In 2000, the City of Seattle adopted a goal of meeting its electricity needs with \"no net greenhouse gas emissions.\" To achieve this goal, the city ordered the city-owned electric utility to offset its GHG emissions by paying others to reduce their GHG emissions. The utility did so, largely through agreements paying other entities to use cleaner fuels. This made the utility (according to its press release) \"the first large electric utility in the country to effectively eliminate its contribution of harmful greenhouse gas emissions.\" In Okeson v. City of Seattle , 150 P.3d 556 (Wash. 2007) (en banc), however, the utility's ratepayers argued that this offset arrangement was not authorized by the state's utility enabling act. The Washington Supreme Court agreed, explaining that the purchase of GHG offsets was not impliedly authorized by the enabling act in that the offset contracts were not proprietary because they were not part of the services for which ratepayers are billed, nor were they within the enabling act's purposes. A pair of cases deals with permit applications by electric utilities seeking to build new facilities. In In re Otter Tail Power Co ., 744 N.W.2d 594 (S.D. 2008), environmental intervenors urged the South Dakota public utilities commission to deny a permit to build a coal-fired energy conversion facility, in light of the substantial CO 2 it would emit. Notwithstanding, the commission granted the permit, and the state supreme court sustained. The commission, it held, was not clearly erroneous in finding that the added CO 2 threatened no \"serious\" injury to the environment, the state's statutory standard. Deference to the commission was particularly appropriate, it said, because the CO 2 from the facility would increase national CO 2 emissions by only .07%, and neither Congress nor the state had chosen to regulate CO 2 emissions. By contrast, the permit was initially denied in Kansas. After applying for a PSD construction permit for two 700-megawatt coal-fired power plants, the Sunflower Electric Power Corp. initially received a favorable response from the state agency, which asserted it would not consider CO 2 in connection with the application owing to the national and international character of climate change. Later, however, the agency invoked a state law providing it with emergency powers when emissions present a substantial endangerment to the health of persons or the environment. Using this authority, and specifically citing the large volume of CO 2 from the proposed plants, the agency denied the permit in 2007. Three times in 2008 and once in 2009 the Kansas legislature passed laws that would have required Sunflower's application to be evaluated without taking CO 2 emissions into account, but each was vetoed by Governor Sebelius. In response to the 2008 vetoes, Sunflower filed several suits now pending in state and federal court. In federal court, in Sunflower Electric Power Corp. v. Sebelius , No. 08-2575 (D. Kan. filed November 17, 2008), Sunflower alleged first that the permit denial violates equal protection because it prohibits CO 2 emissions from the proposed plants when the state has authorized, and continues to authorize, other CO 2 sources in Kansas. Second, Sunflower claims a violation of the Dormant Commerce Clause in that the permit denial was allegedly motivated by the fact that much of the electricity to be generated by the proposed plants would be sold out of state. With the arrival of a new governor, however, a deal was struck on May 4, 2009, allowing one 895-megawatt coal-fired power plant to be built. Reportedly the deal includes Sunflower's dismissal of the federal suit. Research reveals only one lawsuit contesting insurance policy coverage of injuries or liability arising from climate change, though the future is likely to see more. One of the energy companies sued in tort by the Village of Kivalina (see Section V) is now being sued by the insurance company holding its commercial general liability policy. Steadfast Insurance Co. v. The AES Corporation , No. 2008-858 (Va. County Ct. filed July 9, 2008). The insurance company seeks a declaratory judgment that, it hopes, will decree it is not obligated under the policy to provide either defense or indemnity coverage to the energy company in the litigation brought by the Village of Kivalina. The insurer's arguments are three: (1) the policy applies only to an \"accident,\" which is not the basis of the suit against the energy company by the Kivalina plaintiffs; (2) the policies do not apply to injury that began before the earliest of the insurance policies (September 2003), which the injuries here did; and (3) all of the conditions for avoiding the policy's pollution exclusion have not been met (e.g., the pollution alleged by the Kivalina complaint was not unexpected). More significant than the coverage of current liability and casualty policies is the long-term challenge posed by climate change to the insurance industry. Reports suggest that the successor to the Kyoto Protocol may contain provisions by which wealthy industrialized nations contribute to the adaptation costs of developing countries affected by climate change. Lurking in the background, however, is the question whether the major GHG emitting nations can be sued in international fora for the adverse effects of climate change. Gauging the viability of such claims involves a good deal of guesswork, as they lie on the frontiers of international law. This report, concerned primarily with actually filed claims, notes only a few highlights, taken mostly from what appears to be the most pertinent article in the area. The article suggests that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) might be one forum for resolution of climate change claims, with jurisdiction established through treaties that specifically provide for dispute resolution before the court. A problem with the ICJ approach is that the treaties most likely to be invoked are Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation or similar treaties, which focus on how each party within its own country treats the other country's nationals and property. A climate change suit, by contrast, likely would have an extraterritorial focus. Another ICJ possibility would be for the court to render an advisory opinion, at the request of a body authorized under the U.N. Charter to request one. Other possibilities include voluntary submission of a climate change dispute to any of several international arbitral forums or resort to the specialized dispute resolution systems created under various treaties. An example of the latter, reportedly being actively considered, is a fisheries conservation agreement under the UN Law of the Sea Convention, presumably on the argument that increased ocean temperatures from climate change imperil certain fish stocks. Some principles that might be applied to a claim alleging GHG-caused injury might be taken from the international law of transboundary pollution. For example, the Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law describes an international law principle under which a nation must \"take such measures as may be necessary, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, to ensure that activities within its jurisdiction or control ... are conducted so as not to cause significant injury to the environment of another state....\" Similarly, the Trail Smelter arbitration decision, probably the seminal ruling on state liability for transboundary pollution, declared that \"[a] State owes at all times a duty to protect other States against injurious acts by individuals from within its jurisdiction.\" Of course, as with the domestic common law litigation described in Section V, daunting hurdles confront the claimant in making the link between climate change in general and specific environmental harms, and in apportioning how much of such harms are attributable to the charged party or parties, in this instance the United States. Research reveals only one climate-change-related international law action filed against the United States. Not surprisingly, it was filed by a group based in the Arctic, where the temperature rise from climate change has been among the fastest. In 2005, the Chair of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, on behalf of herself and all affected Inuit of the arctic regions of the United States and Canada, filed a petition against the United States with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the investigative arm of the Organization of American States (OAS). The petition alleged that the United States, through its failure to restrict its GHG emissions and the resultant climate change, has violated the Inuit's human rights—including their rights to their culture, to property, to the preservation of health, life, and physical integrity, and so on. Inuit culture is described in the petition as \"inseparable from the condition of [its] physical surroundings.\" Generally, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is empowered to recommend measures that contribute to human rights protection, request states in urgent cases to adopt specific precautionary measures to avoid serious harm to human rights, or submit cases to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The United States, however, has not accepted the jurisdiction of this court, so the Inuit petition sought only to have the Commission prepare a report declaring the responsibilities of the United States and recommending corrective measures. In 2006, the Inuit petition was rejected, with no reasons given (as is customary for the Commission). However, at the request of petitioners the Commission held a hearing on March 1, 2007 on the generic issue of climate change and human rights. One may speculate that the Commission felt more comfortable with the hearing format than the petition because the former did not single out the United States. Or that the Commission was concerned the petition took it into a realm of global scale, orders of magnitude vaster than the typical human rights petition it receives. In 2005-2006, five petitions were submitted to the Intergovernmental Committee for the Protection of the Cultural and Natural Heritage of Outstanding Universal Value (World Heritage Committee), part of UNESCO. The petitions request that various designated World Heritage Sites be placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger owing to alleged impacts of climate change. The sites covered by the petitions are Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park (U.S./Canada), Sagarmatha National Park (Nepal), Belize Barrier Reef Reserve System (Belize), Huascaran National Park (Peru), and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). Only the Waterton-Glacier petition was filed by entities within the United States (12 environmental groups) and involves a natural resource within the United States. As a party to the World Heritage Convention, the United States is obligated to \"do all it can ... to the utmost of its own resources and, where appropriate, with any international assistance and cooperation\" to protect its cultural and natural heritage. In 2006, the World Heritage Committee acknowledged the five petitions but appeared desirous of shifting the debate toward the use of existing committee mechanisms at individual sites to adapt to the threat of climate change. Since then, a few additional petitions to place sites on the danger list have been filed, most interestingly a petition titled \"The Role of Black Carbon in Endangering Sites Threatened by Glacial Melt and Sea Level Rise.\" This petition notes that \"[r]ecent scientific studies identify black carbon, a component of fine particulate matter, as a key climate forcing agent….\" It then asserts that high latitude and high altitude glaciers and low-elevation sites are the World Heritage Sites most vulnerable to climate change, and lists 15 sites (including those in the preceding paragraph) that should be placed on the danger list. Waterton-Glacier remains the only site mentioned in a petition for placement on the List of World Heritage in Danger that is in the United States. Thus far, no international law claims have been brought by low-lying nations likely to be inundated by the sea level rise predicted to accompany climate change. A recent scientific report asserts that sea level rise is likely to be larger than previously predicted, affecting as many as 600 million people on low-lying Pacific islands and southeast Asia delta areas. Gauging the prospects of the pending climate change lawsuits is a precarious venture; for many of the suits, there is little precedent. It is clear, however, that success in the conventional sense—obtaining a judgment for the environmental plaintiff—is not the only objective of many of these suits. Some of the climate change litigation almost certainly has a long-range strategic purpose—to keep climate change on the political front burner and make it difficult for government and GHG emitters to ignore the problem. In the conventional sense of the term, plaintiffs' successes have been rare in cases seeking relief directly from GHG emitters . A court may be reluctant to impose expensive measures to address a global problem on a defendant that is a proportionately minor contributor (which almost all defendants are, given the vast number of GHG emitters), using statutory provisions or common law principles that were not formulated with global problems in mind, against a backdrop of scientific uncertainty as to the precise consequences (if not the general cause) of climate change. By contrast, the environmental side recently has scored major wins where governmental remedies were sought. In a string of 2007 decisions under the Clean Air Act, Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975, foreign policy authority of the United States, and NEPA, courts have shown increased willingness to authorize or require government consideration of climate change. As this report shows, standing has been a persistent issue for environmental plaintiffs, though of late the tide appears to be shifting in their favor. And at least for states, the Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA is likely to work a sea change in improving plaintiffs' prospects. As noted earlier, the big question is the extent to which the Supreme Court decision finding standing will be seen by the lower courts to generalize to nonstate plaintiffs, other statutory and common law contexts, and injuries (as from weather events) not as clearly attributable to climate change as Massachusetts's loss of shore land. Causation is not only a component of the threshold standing test but a component of the plaintiff's case on the merits. Several writers have identified proof of causation as a key obstacle to a tort action seeking relief from climate change injury. And at the remedy stage, allocation of damages among specific defendants will likely present both factual and legal challenges. In either the standing or case-in-chief contexts, the climate change issues in private-remedy actions reprise an intractable problem in environmental law: imposing liability for harms that are remote in time and place from the pollution sought to be abated, particularly where the pollution comes from multiple sources. Lawmakers of yesteryear encountered this same redistributive conundrum in tackling the problem of acid rain, where pollution cause and effect are separated by hundreds of miles and weeks or months. Imposing liability for harm from exposure to toxic chemicals is of the same ilk: exposure to contamination from multiple sources may result in ill effects manifested only a decade or two later. Perhaps because of these hurdles under existing law, and the resistance of the George W. Bush Administration to regulatory approaches to climate change, new directions have been explored. Within the United States, several states have adopted their own GHG emission controls, citing, among other things, inaction at the federal level. Twenty-three states have joined one of the three regional GHG reduction initiatives (Western Climate Initiative, Midwestern Regional Greenhouse Gas Reduction Accord, and in the northeastern states, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative). Some states have explored the idea of emissions trading with Europe. At least 40 states and multiple Canadian provinces have partnered to form a Climate Registry to support voluntary and mandatory schemes for reporting GHG emissions in those states and provinces. California and the United Kingdom signed an agreement on July 31, 2006, committing both parties to implement market-based mechanisms, to share results from studies to quantify the economic impacts of climate change, collaborate on research, etc. Also internationally, this report noted the unsuccessful Inuit petition filed with the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the pending petitions before the World Heritage Committee. Reportedly, the low-lying Pacific nation of Tuvalu threatened to sue the United States and Australia years ago in the ICJ, but held off for unspecified reasons. In the corporate world, use of the shareholder proposal process and SEC disclosure requirements have been suggested as ways of forcing the issue. New categories of litigation also may emerge. For example, the head of the California Air Resources Board has predicted a court challenge to her state's cap-and-trade system to regulate GHGs (expected to take effect in 2012). Such a challenge, she said, might argue that the cap-and-trade system's fee on GHG emissions imposes a new tax, which requires a 2/3 vote of the state legislature. As another example, rising sea levels may prompt lawsuits seeking a judicial blessing for the landward migration of the public's beach access rights. And of course, any climate change legislation enacted by Congress is likely to spawn its own generation of litigation. Whether these new paths will yield results, only time will tell. It is clear, however, that if there is to be a government response to climate change at all, a solution from the political branches is more likely to be comprehensive and fully reflective of societal priorities than the typically narrowly targeted results of litigation. Many proponents of litigation or unilateral action by the states freely concede that such initiatives are make-do efforts that, while making a small contribution to mitigating climate change, are also aimed at prodding the national government to act.", "reference": "The scientific, economic, and political questions surrounding climate change have long been with us. This report focuses instead on a relative newcomer: the legal debate. Though the first court decision related to climate change appeared 19 years ago, such litigation has proliferated in just the past six. Representatives of some suing organizations and states acknowledge that a prime cause for this litigation surge was inaction by Congress and the executive branch during the George W. Bush Administration with regard to mandatory constraints on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The court cases, decided and pending, arise in eight contexts. The first is the Clean Air Act (CAA). In Massachusetts v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that as to mobile sources of emissions (cars, trucks), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has authority under the act to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This decision puts pressure on EPA to move forward as well with regulation of GHGs from stationary sources (power plants, factories). Second, litigation under wildlife statutes, particularly the Endangered Species Act, raises the possibility that the impacts of climate change on wildlife may constrain private activities that emit GHGs. Third, energy statutes have been invoked. It has been held, for example, that under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the United States must monetize the benefits of reduced carbon emissions as part of setting light-truck fuel economy standards. Fourth, various statutes requiring federal government analysis and information dissemination—the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), Global Change Research Act (GCRA), and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)—have generated climate-change litigation. NEPA suits make up the most numerous subset of this category. Courts agree that if a plaintiff can establish standing, NEPA can be used to compel agency consideration of the climate change effects of its actions. Fifth, common law tort theories such as nuisance have been invoked, not yet successfully, to force cutbacks in GHG emissions, or payment of damages. Several cases are on appeal. Sixth are the preemption suits. These challenge state regulation of GHG emissions from motor vehicles as preempted by the federal corporate average fuel economy standards or federal authority over foreign policy. The two rulings thus far have rejected these challenges, but are on appeal. California's suit attacking EPA's denial of its request for a waiver of federal preemption under the Clean Air Act has now been stayed, pending EPA reconsideration of the denial. Seventh, chiefly with respect to coal-fired power plants, are suits under state utilities laws. And eighth, one case asks whether existing general liability insurance policies cover climate-change-related liability. Finally, the report discusses international law aspects of a nation's contributions to climate change, and offers some overview comments.", "prediction": "In a preliminary ruling, the court held that plaintiffs have standing, notwithstanding that the climate change impacts of the plant's GHG emissions would be \"indirect.\" On the authority question, the Court said that the CAA's broad definition of \"air pollutant\" simply cannot be squared with EPA's view that GHGs are not included. It is \"reasonably probable,\" said the court, that emissions from projects supported by the defendants will threaten plaintiffs' concrete interests."}
{"index": 9, "model": "ELMo-Extractive", "source": "Many U.S. policymakers have viewed the resumption of all U.S. beef exports to South Korea—the third-largest U.S. beef export market in 2003—as essential, but not necessarily all that is required, before the U.S. Congress considers legislation to implement the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). To facilitate this, in April 2008 the U.S. and Korean governments agreed on (but subsequently modified) the rules that Korea will apply to U.S. beef imports to ensure that shipments meet Korean human health standards. South Korea's aim was to improve the prospects so that the Bush Administration would send the KORUS FTA to Congress before the end of 2008. This did not occur, however, for the reasons explained below. In late June 2010, President Obama directed U.S. trade officials to work with their South Korean counterparts to resolve outstanding matters related to U.S. beef access and the agreement's automobile provisions by the time he met with South Korean President Lee in Seoul in mid-November 2010. In the talks that led to the December 2010 supplemental agreement, the issue of full U.S. beef access was not resolved because of its political sensitivity in South Korea. This report describes the beef provisions in the KORUS FTA and the separate bilateral protocols that the United States has negotiated in order to secure the lifting of South Korea's ban on U.S. beef imports, imposed after the discovery of mad cow disease in late 2003. It also summarizes U.S. beef export developments to this key market before and after the ban and since these protocols took effect and lays out the outstanding issues on U.S. beef access that have been raised in advance of expected congressional consideration of the KORUS FTA this fall. Beginning in the late 1990s, South Korea became a growing and important market for major beef exporters, particularly the United States. In 2003, beef imports accounted for nearly 75% of South Korean beef consumption. U.S. shipments that year alone supplied half of all of the beef consumed by Korean consumers. By 2003, South Korea had become the third-largest export market for U.S. beef. That year, U.S. beef exports to South Korea totaled $815 million ( Figure 1 ), or 246,595 metric tons (MT) ( Figure 2 ), and accounted for 21% of the $3.9 billion in U.S. beef products shipped worldwide. Beef exports represented 28% of all U.S. agricultural exports to Korea. Boneless beef products accounted for $449 million (55% of the total). Bone-in beef exports totaled $292 million (36%). Sales of beef variety meats (primary offals—tongue, liver, heart, and other edible cattle parts) were $65 million (8%). Processed beef product shipments were valued at $9 million (1%). The U.S. market share of Korea's beef imports reached 69% ( Figure 3 ). After the first U.S. case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, was discovered in a Canadian-born cow in Washington State in December 2003, South Korea and many other countries banned imports of U.S. beef. BSE is a fatal, neurodegenerative disease of cattle thought to arise from the consumption of animal-derived protein supplements added to feed. Scientists believe that this disease can be transmitted to humans who eat the brain, spinal cord, or other high-risk tissues of BSE-infected cattle, which causes a variant form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). This is a very rare and incurable degenerative neurological disorder (brain disease) that is ultimately fatal. U.S. government efforts to regain partial access to the key Korean market took two years to negotiate. In January 2006, South Korea agreed to a protocol that allowed imports of U.S. boneless beef only from cattle less than 30 months old . At that time, the under-30-months-old criterion was based on the widely held view that cattle younger than 30 months were less susceptible to mad cow disease. U.S. negotiators had signaled that some opening on the beef issue was necessary before negotiations with South Korea on a comprehensive FTA could begin. Difficulties experienced in exporting beef later that year to Korea under this first agreement, however, began to affect the negotiating dynamics of the overall FTA, even though this issue was not on the formal agenda. Separate bilateral discussions on this sensitive issue moved from the technical level to high-level meetings as both sides raced to conclude the KORUS FTA by the end of the March 2007 deadline set by then-in-effect trade promotion authority. However, the beef issue was not resolved by the time both countries concluded this trade agreement. Then-South Korean President Roh Moo-hyun, in a national address on April 1, 2007, stated he had personally promised President Bush that his government would \"uphold the recommendations\" of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) on the BSE risk status of the United States and \"open the Korean [beef] market at a reasonable level.\" The OIE is the international scientific body recognized by the World Trade Organization as the reference for matters of animal disease and health. On May 22, 2007, the OIE formally found that the United States is a \"controlled risk\" country for the spread of mad cow disease. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) top official on this matter commented that this \"risk classification recognizes that OIE-recommended, science-based measures are in place to effectively manage any possible risk of BSE in the [U.S.] cattle population\" and \"provides strong support that U.S. regulatory controls are effective and that U.S. cattle and products from cattle of all ages can be safely traded in accordance with international guidelines, due to our interlocking safeguards.\" USDA immediately requested that South Korea amend its import requirements for U.S. beef within a specified time frame to reflect this risk determination and to reopen its market to all U.S. cattle and beef products. In response, South Korea's animal health regulatory agency began an eight-step process to assess the BSE risks of the U.S. beef sector in light of the OIE finding, with the intent to negotiate a revised bilateral agreement that would lay out import rules applicable to U.S. beef. Against this backdrop, U.S. boneless beef exports resumed in late April 2007, with occasional breaks when Korean inspectors refused entry to some shipments that contained bones or did not meet other requirements laid out in the January 2006 agreement. With the third discovery of prohibited bones on October 5, 2007, South Korean authorities announced they would not conduct any more inspections of U.S. beef until both sides concluded formal negotiations to revise the 2006 protocol. Minimal U.S. beef offal exports occurred in 2004, 2005, and 2006 ( Figure 1 and Figure 2 ), due to South Korea's ban on imports after the first U.S. BSE-infected cow was discovered in December 2003. Though some U.S. boneless beef sales occurred in the last few months of 2006 after South Korea agreed to implement the January 2006 agreement, Korean inspectors rejected these shipments after discovering small bone fragments in a few boxes. From 2004 to 2006, beef shipments from Australia and New Zealand increased substantially to cover South Korean demand that had previously been met by U.S. beef exporters ( Figure 3 ). In 2007, both countries accounted for 92% of South Korea's beef imports, compared to 29% in 2003. U.S. boneless beef exports to South Korea resumed in late April 2007 and continued through early October 2007, when bone fragments again were found. During this period, Korea's quarantine regulatory agency inspected and cleared for retail sale most U.S. boneless beef shipments, applying its interpretation of the January 2006 agreement. Even with partial-year exports, South Korea ranked as the fourth-largest market for U.S. beef in 2007, with sales of $119 million ( Figure 1 ), or 25,165 MT ( Figure 2 ). The long-standing U.S. negotiating position had been to press for full access in one step for all U.S. beef into South Korea's market. This meant expanding the scope of the 2006 agreement to include exports of bone-in beef and coverage of all U.S. beef from cattle, regardless of age , as long as BSE-risk materials are removed during processing. U.S. trade officials maintained that U.S. beef is safe, pointing out that it is consumed by millions of Americans. They frequently noted that the U.S. measures in place to prevent the introduction of BSE in U.S. cattle herds already meet international scientific standards as spelled out by the OIE. South Korea argued for a \"two-phased\" approach to a full opening. The first step would allow imports of both boneless and bone-in beef cuts from U.S. cattle less than 30 months old. Cattle parts identified by the OIE as agents that can transmit BSE to cattle and in turn, potentially harm humans, would have to be removed from imported beef. Korea's trade minister argued this first step would give the United States about 80% of the market share it had before the ban on U.S. beef took effect in late 2003. The second step to take effect later would permit imports of beef from older cattle, as long as risk materials are removed according to OIE's standards. Just hours before newly elected Korean President Lee met President Bush at Camp David on April 18, 2008, U.S. and South Korean negotiators reached agreement on the sanitary rules that Korea will apply to beef imports from the United States. It allows for imports of all cuts of U.S. boneless and bone-in beef and other beef products from the edible parts of cattle, irrespective of age , as long as specified risk materials (SRMs) known to transmit mad cow disease are removed and other conditions are met. However, both sides revised this deal in a late-June private-sector arrangement that will for an unspecified time period limit sales of U.S. beef (boneless and bone-in) only to cattle less than 30 months old when slaughtered. Combined, these terms significantly expanded upon the products covered by the January 2006 protocol, which only permitted imports of boneless beef from cattle under 30 months old. The April 2008 agreement requires the removal of specified risk materials (SRMs) during meat processing, and prohibits the entry of (1) all mechanically recovered and mechanically separated meat and (2) advanced meat recovery (AMR) product from the skull and vertebral column of cattle 30 months of age and over at the time of slaughter. These prohibitions reflect scientific conclusions that these materials can harbor the BSE agent in cattle and in turn infect humans if product from such cattle is consumed. Other provisions detail which other beef products can enter, or are prohibited from entering, South Korea. The agreement also prescribes the steps that South Korea's quarantine inspection agency can take if banned cattle parts or other problems are found in a shipment from a U.S. meat firm, and specifies what its counterpart U.S. agency (USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service) must do to address the matter. These are intended to serve as a map for handling specific problems in a way that does not stop altogether the flow of all U.S. beef exports to South Korea. Other rules spell out the requirements that U.S. beef processing plants and the FSIS must meet, in order for beef and beef products to be sold to South Korea. The private-sector deal announced on June 21, 2008, reflects a \"commercial understanding\" reached between Korean beef importers and U.S. exporters, that as \"a transitional measure,\" only U.S. beef from cattle under 30 months of age will be sold to Korea. The U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), in acknowledging the request made by the U.S. meat industry for Korea's beef importers, stated that the U.S. government will meet this request under a Quality System Assessment (QSA) program that will verify that beef destined for Korea will be from cattle less than 30 months old. This program will be voluntary—operating only at those beef processing plants that seek to sell beef and beef products to that market. (See \" Implementation of 2008 Beef Access Agreement \" for status of this QSA program.) While the U.S. beef industry and U.S. policymakers welcomed the April deal, Korean TV coverage of the issue and Internet-spread rumors that questioned the safety of U.S. beef sparked large candlelight vigils in South Korea to protest the beef agreement. Opposition political parties soon joined these protests, advocating that the government renegotiate or scrap the agreement. Farmers also called for the National Assembly (Korea's parliament) to reject the KORUS FTA when considered during a special session later in May 2008. Opponents argued that the Korean government moved too quickly to strike a deal, and did not secure enough safeguards against the dangers of mad cow disease. These developments, in turn, adversely affected the political standing of Korea's new president and his government's inability to pursue his ruling political party's policy agenda—one item being the approval by the National Assembly of the KORUS FTA. To respond to mounting public pressure, the Korean government twice pursued talks with the United States to find ways to defuse public concerns without \"renegotiating\" the beef agreement. A May 19, 2008, exchange of letters affirms that South Korea has the right under international agreements to take steps to protect its citizens from health and safety risks (i.e., suspend U.S. beef imports if a BSE-infected cow is discovered in the United States). On June 21, 2008, both governments confirmed a \"voluntary private sector\" arrangement that allows Korean firms to import U.S. beef produced only from cattle less than 30 months old, and announced some changes to the April agreement. Although South Korea secured the application of the under-30-months-old criterion with respect to U.S. beef imports, the OIE in contrast makes no age distinction in assessing the risk level of cattle slaughtered for beef. Instead, its recommendation is that importing countries, to prevent the introduction of BSE, ensure that beef of any age meet certain conditions, such as the removal of those cattle tissues suspected of transmitting BSE and the implementation of effective safety controls for cattle feed. Though the United States for some time has argued that it is in full compliance with OIE guidelines, U.S. negotiators appear to have had little choice but to compromise in a way that would allow some sales to resume. Publicly, both countries presented this arrangement as a transitional step to improve Korean consumer confidence in U.S. beef, and did not commit to any timetable for revisiting this matter. Some Members of Congress responded cautiously or skeptically to the \"voluntary commercial agreement,\" noting that it changes the April protocol by allowing Korea to reject U.S. beef from cattle over 30 months of age, disregards international standards that affirm the safety of all U.S. beef regardless of age, and sets an \"unfortunate\" or \"dangerous\" precedent in negotiating the terms of beef access into other countries. South Korean government officials portrayed the June-negotiated arrangement as going far to allay public concerns about the safety of U.S. beef. However, the political fallout of the controversy continued through the summer of 2008. Three high-ranking Korean officials (including the agriculture minister and his deputy) resigned because of their involvement in the agreement's negotiations. The Korean National Assembly completed an inconclusive parliamentary inquiry on the strategy and process followed by two successive governments on negotiating this agreement. It also debated a controversial livestock sector bill that includes a ban on beef imports from any country whenever a new case of a BSE-infected cattle is discovered. As adopted, the measure reportedly exempts the bilateral beef agreement reached with the United States from being subject to its coverage. Under the KORUS FTA, South Korea would eliminate over a 15-year period its 40% tariff on beef muscle meats imported from the United States. South Korea also would have the right to impose additional tariffs on a temporary basis in response to any surges in imports of U.S. beef meats above specified levels. The trigger for this additional tariff would be 270,000 metric tons (MT) in year 1, and would increase 2% annually. In year 15, the trigger would be 354,000 MT. In year 16, this protective safeguard mechanism would no longer apply. Separately, the 18% tariff on imports of beef offals (tongues, livers, tails and feet), and tariffs ranging from 22.5% to 72% on other beef products, would also be eliminated in 15 years. Assuming that South Korea fully lifts its restrictions on U.S. beef, and bilateral beef trade returns to normal, the U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) estimates that the phase-out of South Korea's beef tariff and safeguard could increase U.S. beef exports by about $600 million to $1.8 billion (58% to 165%) above what would be the case without this agreement. In another analysis, the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) projects that U.S. beef sales would be $265 million higher than otherwise as the United States recaptures its historic share of the South Korean market. However, the AFBF notes that the market share of U.S. beef likely will not increase over time, because South Korean tastes have developed a preference for grass-fed Australian beef, which will continue to be competitive in price against U.S. beef even if the current 40% tariff is removed. A more recent analysis by USDA's Economic Research Service estimates that U.S. beef exports would be $563 million higher under KORUS than without a trade agreement, and would account for almost one-third of the growth in additional U.S. agricultural imports. Key U.S. interest groups have frequently acknowledged that the full benefits associated with the KORUS FTA's beef market access provisions can only be attained if both countries work through the issue of addressing South Korea's lingering concerns about the safety of U.S. beef exports. Cattle producers are divided on their support for the KORUS FTA. The National Cattlemen's Beef Association (NCBA) and the U.S. Cattlemen's Association (USCA) are in favor. The Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America (R-CALF USA) opposes it. Beef processors and packers, represented by the American Meat Institute (AMI) and the National Meat Association (NMA), support this agreement. In accordance with the April 2008 beef protocol, as modified by the June 2008 private-sector arrangement, South Korea on June 26, 2008, published rules to put the beef agreement into effect, and began to inspect U.S. beef shipments held in cold storage in Korea since the fall of 2007. Shortly thereafter, USDA agencies began implementing the procedures adopted to ensure that U.S. beef meets Korea's import requirements. Under these terms, each U.S. beef shipment to Korea must be accompanied by an export certificate issued by USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) that confirms the U.S. beef establishment participates in two programs administered by USDA's Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The first is that beef and products destined for South Korea must be produced under an approved Export Verification (EV) program. This details the specific product requirements that a supplier must meet in order for an export shipment to be eligible to enter Korea. Currently, AMS lists 58 suppliers as covered by the EV program for Korea. The second is the voluntary Quality System Assessment (QSA) program that verifies that beef from a participating plant is from cattle under 30 months of age. Currently, AMS has approved 54 exporting establishments as eligible to ship beef product that can be certified as meeting this requirement. To meet initial consumer demand following the reopening of South Korea's market to U.S. beef, shipments accelerated from mid-July 2008 through early October 2008 to supply regional wholesale markets and such retail sales outlets as local traditional butcher shops and online stores. With the build-up among importers of unsold inventories, export shipments then fell through year-end 2008. Perceiving a change in consumer sentiment towards U.S. beef, three large Korean discount retail chains began selling U.S. beef in late November 2008. Sales of U.S. beef in these major sales outlets were strong in December, largely due to discount pricing ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). For 2008 as a whole, U.S. beef exports to South Korea totaled $294 million ( Figure 1 ) or 57,269 MT ( Figure 2 ). Of this total, sales of bone-in beef products (previously prohibited) were $118 million. Compared to 2007, these U.S. beef exports were 148% higher in value and 128% greater in quantity. Even though sales occurred for only half the year, South Korea ranked as the fourth-largest market for U.S. beef. For 2008 as a whole, the U.S. market share of all of Korea's beef imports rose to 15%, up from 6% in 2007 ( Figure 3 ). In 2009 , U.S. beef sales to South Korea totaled $216 million ( Figure 1 ) or 55,633 MT ( Figure 2 ). Compared to 2008, these exports were lower by nearly 27% in value and 3% in quantity. South Korea again ranked as the fourth-largest destination for U.S. beef in dollar terms. The U.S. market share further increased to 26%, at the expense of Australia and New Zealand ( Figure 3 ). Exports fell in the first quarter of 2009, as importers worked down their inventories of frozen U.S. beef that had entered earlier. One positive development was the decision of large department store chains (another major marketing outlet) to resume sales. This reflected an acknowledgment by these other retailers that public opposition to U.S. beef had eased, with no significant problems reported since sales had begun at the discount retail stores. In the second and third quarters of 2009, U.S. beef exports to South Korea stabilized at a lower level, in part due to household decisions to tighten spending (i.e., less restaurant dining, where U.S. beef would frequently be consumed) in response to the uncertainty caused by Korea's economic recession ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). The availability of cheaper Australian beef because of the Australian dollar's more favorable exchange rate against the Korean won also reduced the price-competitiveness of U.S. beef during this period. USDA reported that imports were slowed by the difficulties that importers experienced in securing credit due to the financial squeeze and the weak won relative to the U.S. dollar, and by \"ample\" inventories of U.S. beef sitting in cold storage. It also attributed the slower pace of sales to the lingering negative image of U.S. beef among Korean consumers. For 2010 , U.S. beef exports to South Korea totaled $518 million, or 112,757 MT, a 140% increase in value and a 103% increase in quantity over 2009. U.S. beef shipments constituted 32% of total South Korean beef imports, a noticeable increase from the 26% share posted in 2009 ( Figure 3 ). Promotional efforts to rebuild consumer confidence in U.S. beef and much lower retail prices for imported beef than for Korean beef contributed to the continued growth in U.S. beef sales throughout the year ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). Since December 2009, the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) has conducted a \"Trust Campaign\" to rebuild consumer confidence in U.S. beef using television and newspaper advertisements and other promotional activities. Major Korean \"hypermarkets\"—superstores that combine a supermarket with a department store—have engaged in aggressive marketing efforts that are reported to have increased U.S. beef's share of imported beef sold by these stores. Retail prices for Korean-produced beef on average were 2 to 2½ times more expensive than imported beef. Though U.S. beef sales have increased, USDA reported that \"there are still a sizeable percentage of fence sitting consumers who haven't started buying U.S. beef again.\" To win these consumers back, marketing efforts are being targeted toward this group. Also, while the more upscale restaurants are selling U.S. beef, smaller establishments \"are still a bit reluctant to include it on their menus for fear of losing customers.\" To respond, the USMEF plans additional marketing efforts to reach these smaller restaurants. During the first five months of 2011 , U.S. beef exports to South Korea totaled $331 million ( Figure 1 ) or 76,208 MT ( Figure 2 ), a 103% (in value) and a 105% (in quantity) increase over the same period in 2010. U.S. beef shipments represented 37% of Korea's beef imports, another noticeable increase from the 30% share posted in the January-May 2010 period ( Figure 3 ). The surge in beef imports not only from the United States but also from Australia responded to the outbreak of foot and mouth disease late in 2010. With hog herds culled significantly, together with some cattle, to prevent its spread, available Korean meat supplies fell. Importers moved quickly to meet demand. U.S. exports increased quickly during the first quarter ( Figure 4 and Figure 5 ). Shipments have since fallen back to the levels seen in the last three quarters of 2010. An industry representative remains \"quite bullish\" on the Korean market because of strong demand, noting that the strong export sales pace \"was not really sustainable.\" Although the protests against the beef agreement subsided in the summer of 2008, they have had lingering effects on U.S.-South Korean relations because of their erosion of President Lee's standing early in his term and because of their possible effects on the ratification of the KORUS FTA. The protests damaged the president's political strength and boosted the position of opposition groups that had been demoralized before the candlelight vigils. In the late summer of 2008, Lee's approval ratings recovered from the trough they entered at the height of the protests, but for months they remained at a low level (in the mid-20% to 30% range). Thus, the uproar over Lee's decisions on beef effectively ruined his \"honeymoon\" period to push many of his policy goals. It was not until late 2009 that Lee's poll numbers began to exceed 40% fairly consistently. Perhaps most significantly for the United States, the beef protests meant that President Lee has lacked the political capital and/or the political will to completely eliminate the beef ban, as the Obama Administration and various Members of Congress have asked. Perhaps for this reason, the remnants of Korea's beef ban were not linked to the 2010 KORUS FTA negotiations that culminated in the December 3 supplementary agreement. The domestic uproar in Korea following the April 2008 beef deal had increased the perception among many South Koreans that Lee was overly solicitous toward the United States. Had he compromised again on the beef issue in late 2010, it is possible that securing passage of the KORUS FTA through Korea's National Assembly would have become more difficult. Concluding the 2008 bilateral beef agreement was considered a significant step forward in the U.S. government's 4½-year effort to regain access to South Korea's lucrative beef market for the U.S. cattle and beef processing sectors. It was intended to resolve an issue that some Members of Congress said stood in the way of congressional consideration of legislation to implement the KORUS FTA. While Korea's lifting of the beef ban was widely regarded as a politically necessary condition for the Bush Administration to send this trade agreement to Congress, it has since become a less sufficient condition, because of other opposition that was expressed against the KORUS FTA, particularly over its auto trade provisions. Following President Obama's announcement on June 26, 2010, of his intent to present implementing legislation for the KORUS FTA to Congress \"in the few months\" after the November 2010 G-20 meeting in Seoul, the Administration consulted with Congress and stakeholders on how to resolve outstanding matters related to access for U.S. beef in the South Korean market. Discussions focused on what would constitute full access for U.S. beef, as spelled out in the signed April 2008 protocol. The issue that U.S. negotiators faced was how and at what pace the United States could get South Korea to accept all U.S. beef, irrespective of the age of the cattle when slaughtered. However, the requirement that U.S. exporters remove specified risk materials suspected of causing mad cow disease during processing was not at issue. At the same time, U.S. negotiators faced pressure to balance this objective with similar negotiating initiatives to expand upon or regain market access for U.S. beef in such important Asian markets as Japan, Taiwan, and China. Administration officials continued to state that their objective is \"to eventually secure full market access for U.S. beef \" that reflects South Korea's recognition that the United States meets OIE standards. However, public statements made by U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk and then-USDA Under Secretary Jim Miller raised the possibility that the Administration might not require achieving this objective before the KORUS FTA is sent to Congress, and instead might seek to secure commitments from South Korea to move in steps toward that goal. Senator Baucus, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee (which will consider the Administration's bill to approve and implement the KORUS FTA) stated that he wanted access for all U.S. beef and cuts from cattle of any age as a condition for considering and ratifying the KORUS FTA. His statements stressed that the OIE has determined that U.S. beef from cattle irrespective of age can be safely imported, and that 60 countries now recognize this in accepting U.S. beef. Baucus has continued to reiterate that his objective is to see that U.S. beef access in all markets be based on internationally accepted rules, arguing that allowing an FTA partner such as Korea not to follow OIE guidelines would set a \"dangerous precedent.\" Another approach laid out by Senator Grassley, then ranking Member of the Finance Committee, would be to pursue efforts to secure additional beef access \"in parallel to the FTA approval process.\" Much of the U.S. cattle and beef industry wants to see the KORUS FTA take effect soon in order to realize the benefit of the reduction in South Korea's 40% tariff on beef muscle cut imports. The industry points to the fact that U.S. beef exports continue to grow, and that the U.S. market share of Korea's beef import market is increasing. Industry spokesmen expressed some apprehension about losing these gains, if U.S. negotiators push South Korea too quickly for full beef access. Their stance likely reflected a desire to avoid a repeat of the street protests that occurred in May 2008, to preclude a public and official perception that the United States is again pressuring South Korea for a policy change. The U.S. beef sector would view such a scenario as undercutting the aggressive market promotion efforts made since late 2008 to assure Korean consumers of the safety of U.S. beef, which it views as having contributed to the increase in U.S. beef exports. Others also have mentioned that securing tariff reductions for U.S. beef would provide a price advantage with respect to beef supplied by Australia and New Zealand, which are seeking similar tariff cuts as both countries negotiate FTAs with South Korea. In the negotiations on the supplemental agreement concluded on December 3, 2010, the beef issue reportedly received little discussion as both sides focused on revising the auto provisions. President Obama, in discussing this outcome the next day, indicated that the United States will continue to work toward \"ensuring full access for U.S. beef to the Korean market.\" Congressional reaction to this outcome was mixed. Senator Baucus expressed \"deep disappointment\" that the supplemental deal \"fails to address Korea's significant barriers to American beef exports.\" He stated his commitment to \"right this wrong\" and to work with the Administration to ensure that ranchers \"are not left behind.\" Two months later, Senator Baucus said he will not support the KORUS FTA until South Korea opens up its beef market. A few other Senators, though concerned with the lack of progress on beef, viewed the deal positively and welcomed the prospect for considering the KORUS FTA in 2011. Meat industry groups again expressed support for this trade agreement that they expect over time will significantly increase their exports to South Korea, and urged Congress to move quickly to ratify it. Beef interests, also supportive, called for continued efforts to secure full market access. Memories of the size and intensity of the 2008 anti-beef agreement protests in South Korea appear to have directly influenced the position taken on the beef issue by Korean negotiators. Reflecting this political sensitivity, they reportedly rejected any discussion on this matter in the negotiations held in early November leading up to the summit between Presidents Obama and Lee and in the final talks leading to the supplemental agreement. Their position was that this issue \"did not fall under\" the FTA concluded in 2007. Since then, South Korea's trade minister has confirmed that there will be no more discussions on ending the age limits of U.S. cattle slaughtered for beef. This stance was affirmed by South Korea's ambassador to Washington in late January 2011. Seeking to move closer toward submitting the KORUS FTA to Congress for consideration, the Administration on May 4, 2011, announced two measures it will take on the U.S. beef access issue. In a letter to Senator Baucus, USTR's Ron Kirk committed to request consultations with South Korea on the \"full implementation\" of the protocol (e.g., opening Korea's market \"to all ages and all cuts of U.S. beef\") as soon as this trade agreement takes effect. The letter referenced one specific provision stipulating that bilateral consultations on the interpretation or application of the protocol's terms \"shall be held within seven days\" of a request. USDA also announced a $1 million award to the U.S. Meat Export Federation (USMEF) to be used in 2011 to promote U.S. beef sales in South Korea, and its intent to consider future funding requests from the USMEF to implement its planned five-year market beef promotion strategy in this key market. Senator Baucus welcomed both steps, stating that he will support the KORUS FTA and will work with the Administration on a package of trade measures that includes all three FTAs and renewing trade adjustment assistance and trade preference programs.", "reference": "The Obama Administration had been pressed to resolve the terms of U.S. beef access to South Korea before the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA) goes to Congress for debate. While Korea committed in the FTA to reduce its 40% tariff on imported U.S. beef over a 15-year period, its limits on such imports for human health reasons threatened to undercut this preferential benefit for U.S. exporters. In 2003, South Korea was the third-largest market for U.S. beef exports, prior to the ban its government imposed after the first U.S. cow infected with mad cow disease, or BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), was discovered. U.S. efforts to regain full access became intertwined with the subsequent KORUS negotiations, but did not yield results by the time those talks concluded in April 2007. In reaction, some Members of Congress stated their consideration of, and support for, KORUS depends on South Korea fully opening its market to U.S. beef. On April 18, 2008, U.S. and South Korean negotiators signed a protocol, or agreement, on sanitary rules that Korea will apply to beef imports from the United States. It allows for imports of all cuts of U.S. boneless and bone-in beef and certain beef products from cattle, irrespective of age, as long as specified risk materials known to transmit mad cow disease are removed and other conditions are met. Though the U.S. beef industry and U.S. policymakers welcomed this deal, Korean TV coverage and Internet-spread rumors that questioned the safety of U.S. beef resulted in escalating protests and calls for the beef agreement to be renegotiated or scrapped. U.S. officials countered that measures already in place to prevent the introduction of BSE in U.S. cattle herds meet international scientific standards. To address rising public pressure, the Korean government twice pursued talks with the United States to find ways to defuse these concerns without \"renegotiating\" the beef protocol. This culminated in the June 21, 2008, confirmation by both governments of a \"voluntary private sector\" arrangement that allows Korean firms to import U.S. beef produced from cattle only under 30 months of age. Both governments view this as a transitional step until Korean consumer confidence in the safety of U.S. beef improves. Since the resumption of U.S. beef exports in July 2008, U.S. exporters have worked to recapture this key overseas market. Beef exports to South Korea in 2010 totaled $518 million, about two-thirds of the record 2003 level. In 2011's first five months, exports (at $331 million) were twice the level recorded in the same period the year before. Promotional efforts to rebuild consumer confidence in U.S. beef, aggressive marketing efforts by large store chains, and much lower retail prices for imported beef than for Korean beef account for the continued growth in U.S. beef sales. Following President Obama's mid-2010 decision to present the KORUS FTA to Congress in 2011, Administration officials worked to resolve the beef and auto issues with South Korea. By the time bilateral talks concluded on December 3, 2010, the beef issue reportedly had received little discussion as both sides focused on revising the auto provisions. Korea's position was shaped by the memory of the size and intensity of the 2008 anti-beef agreement protests. President Obama, in discussing this outcome, stated that the United States will continue to work toward \"ensuring full access for U.S. beef to the Korean market.\" To address lingering congressional concerns, the Administration in early May 2011 committed to request consultations with South Korea on the \"full implementation\" of the protocol as soon as KORUS takes effect, and to provide additional funds for U.S. beef promotion activities in the Korean market. Beef and meat industry groups have welcomed the steps made since to submit KORUS to Congress, have expressed their support, and have urged Congress to move quickly to ratify it.", "prediction": "During this period, Korea's quarantine regulatory agency inspected and cleared for retail sale most U.S. boneless beef shipments, applying its interpretation of the January 2006 agreement. On June 21, 2008, both governments confirmed a \"voluntary private sector\" arrangement that allows Korean firms to import U.S. beef produced only from cattle less than 30 months old, and announced some changes to the April agreement. Much of the U.S. cattle and beef industry wants to see the KORUS FTA take effect soon in order to realize the benefit of the reduction in South Korea's 40% tariff on beef muscle cut imports."}
